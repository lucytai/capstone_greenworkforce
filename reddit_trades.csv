careerguidance,technician,post,1bfsfa4,"I’m the only technician left and I’m underpaid, what do I do?","I’m getting a pay raise and my only coworker is quitting on the same day.

Hi guys

I work at a company who’s helpdesk consists only of myself and 1 other employee.

I am the tier 2 tech, they are the tier 1 tech.

My 2 yr is on this upcoming Wednesday.

The same day, my coworker is putting in his 2 week notice, he found a job for 60k and got hired.

I make 42k.
He made 40k.

Long story short the company desperately needs me at this point in time.

I know I’m getting underpaid and undervalued.

I project that they’re going to put me at 48k after my PR, which is still dramatically under what I should be making considering my skill level and contribution to the company.

I’m going to have to bare the brunt of a truly insane volume of work + training a new hire.

How can I use this situation to my advantage to make more money?",101,1710547045.0,

careerguidance,technician,comment,177a5lb,,"Of course! So to do actual testing, you have to get a certification, which at least in the US, means a degree program, at minimum an associates degree. The associate program could be something you go for now, and then go back to school to get your bachelors degree, while giving you an opportunity at a very in demand field.

You could look for lab processor openings - more and more I’m seeing hospitals allow just a high school diploma for this. It would get you into the lab and you would get to handle specimens. 

Depending on your situation, this can be something you do full time and receive benefits with or it’s very easy to do part time. Since hospitals are 24/7, many labs are also 24/7, which would potentially mean evening and weekend hours - which if you wanted to do something while in school that might work. 

When I was in school I got a part time job as a lab assistant at my school. My job was to make culture media for plates, sterilize equipment etc - that’s another possible option to get exposure to that environment that doesn’t require a certification.

Like you mentioned, phlebotomy might also be a good choice. Depending on your state, you may not need certification - but it really helps and it’s typically a shorter program, think maybe six weeks?

 If youre worried about hours and shift rotation what makes you think trades is different?

  In trades you will have to get used to 10-12 hour days of physical labour, different work site every other week. Maybe close by but could be half way across your city.  Hours may be all over the place depending on the site you may work night shift or random hours. 

You will be working in all kinds of weather sometime outside in the rain all day or in the heat. Either way you still have to work your 10 hours soak and wet.

 Your wages will probably be lower most trades start at 18-20$ hour exspect lower with no experience. Raises are few and far in between until you have been there few years or can run a crew. My first year It I was promoted and bumped to 32$.

I will take a nice office with a break room and bathroom any day. I can go home on time after 8 hours and not have to worry about working a new location next day.

If youre tired now and have no time just you wait lol. Try hauling equipment up and down stairs 4 hours a day. Just so you can do the job.

You're not on call but you'll be working 60-70 hours a week. When you're off the clock you have to prep your plan for tomorrow, do your paperwork, shower, eat, etc, all at some crappy truck stop. When you're living in a truck 5-10 days at a time you're still bringing work home with you, it's not just stopping for the night and you're free to do whatever you want for the next 6 hours.

I know trucking is only one example of blue collar work and you might have different interests. I had to try it for myself to really understand what people meant by ""it's a lifestyle"". I know it can be mind numbing working in an office on pointless stuff all day, but the grass isn't necessarily greener over here. You still deal with idiots and jerks. You still have to grind. You get paid by the mile and your company will find every excuse to not pay you detention time or for other things. You have to buy your own tools. You get to ""travel"" but you don't actually get to stop and see anything. You'll get put into sketchy situations on a regular basis and the consequences of your fuck ups can be way worse then as a sys admin.

But honestly, if you're not finding any satisfaction in your current career, and you don't think changing jobs is going to fix it, then try something new. I know a surprising amount of truck drivers who used to work in IT and they've never looked back. But there are a surprising amount who have gone from trucking to IT and never looked back too.

Trades will have some degree of stability, and you can take a commercial or residential routes, and if you get your own gear you van always work for yourself or as a contractor.

The advantages of camp work are: seeing beautiful wilderness, having zero expenses whilst at work, a temporary reprieve from crippling loneliness as you hang out with a bunch of wild and slightly unhinged people. The disadvantages of camp work are: you ain't gonna find a wife out there, and if you find one back home you'll probably lose her.
There are jobs associated with lots of camp work where you can earn decent money without having the danger of being the guy doing the job. Be a camp chef, be a camp cleaner.

Forestry (tree planting, logging, etc): Tree planting is zero investment to get into piece work that will pay well if you can get good. Logging is insanely dangerous but pays very well. I'd say logging is more dangerous than a lot of fisheries.

Fishing: find out what fisheries exist, find out what town the boats leave from, find out when the seasons are. Go a month or so early and hang out at the bar nearest the dock, and on the docks. Talk to everyone. Don't do dragging, it's fucking evil. Don't do krill, whales need it. Don't do large sein net fishing, unless you have personally talked to a local marine biologist who can assure you they manage the fishery sustainably (they don't). Do long lining for halibut etc, do tuna, do crab (maybe not in Alaska), work on boats that have divers, get into related jobs like being a 'packer'.

Mining: I haven't done this myself in any capacity, so I've got no idea. Surely the same basic rules apply, find jobs and apply for them - go do them.

I grew up the son of a residential remodeler. I've done every aspect of residential construction. I've done it in freezing temperatures and 115°  heat on a sunny roof.  I've crawled through insulation and mud. That's basically my childhood and young adult experience.

I've been in IT, software development and cybersecurity for over 25 years now, and I make 6 figures with full benefits, lots of vacation time, holidays are paid and lengthy.  I'm in my late 40s and on track to retire in my young 50s.

So now I renovate our investment homes. Doing so, I often fantasize about quitting the IT game and going back to my roots.I hate office culture and many of the narcissists who dominate it. 

But, then something like a broken water main in freezing weather happens, I'm digging a trench on Christmas day as it's freezing outside, wet and pissed off and I remember why I chose IT.  Or, the last three summers for example, I've sustained heat exhaustion to the point of vomiting as I was clearing land, installing windows and siding, crawling around in an attic rewiring a bathroom electrical circuit.

Recently, I've done some handyman work for a nice payout and tried offering my skills to some other strangers.

The amount of education, training and practice are all gratis that are considered.

> The main difference between these two types of work is the fact that skilled labor requires specialized training whereas unskilled labor does not.

Roofing is a job that requires no formal education, training or licensing. The work is physically demanding but quick to learn.

Compared to something like an electrician or an HVAC technician.

> The major difference is that skilled laborers attend a school or complete an apprenticeship before they can be employed in their position. Meanwhile, an unskilled laborer can be just about any able-bodied person in good health. Make no mistake: unskilled labor isn't easy. It is quite demanding. The distinction is that you do not need any prior experience to perform unskilled labor, just a strong work ethic.

My clients are commercial janitorial companies, plumbers, electricians, construction, etc. I work with them exclusively because THEY MAKE BANK. I also believe in what they do, they keep our world running. My last contract was a cleaning company that made 22 million a year. 

Do doctors do important work? Sure, if I need a surgery or an emergancy, I want a trained pro.

Working as an associate for a large law firm is definitely a stress inducer and sucks and the guy I know who did that hated it and left to go do government work for department of agriculture I think. He lives that cuz it’s always different and weird stuff. He just gets paid 1/3 as much. But he gets like 120 or 139 now. I think he’s GS scale and like GS-13 maybe. 

Anyways there’s benefits to all of it and it’s going to be really hard to decide. But just do your best and give it your all when you try something and you’ll be fine. You can always go back and do it again. I’m in healthcare now and there’s a surprising amount of doctors who don’t start school until their 30s or 40s and just get going with it late. 

My personal dream is to maybe do law now but that’s cuz I really think it’s something I’d enjoy. Took me years to come up with that conclusion though. If I could give vague advice to my 17 year old self I’d tell him to be an HVAC tech while young and start a business and then go to law school when he retires at 30 lol.",2,1703555384.0,kexn4ex

careerguidance,blue collar,comment,18qvr9h,,"Trades can make really really good money, but you have to chase the fields that pay. 200k is not uncommon with the right trade, and a bit of overtime. It's very very important to go union if you're going into the trades. Ruining your body is not an honest concern if you just take care of yourself. Lower earning potential is not a concern if you're willing to chase high paying trades. 

Obviously if you're a residential roofer life is going to fucking suck. Money, health, and conditions are going to be just fine if you're an elevator mechanic. Keep in mind as a union member in most trades you're not paying for either retirement or health care. 

If I were to just work 40 hours a week, and turn down all overtime I'd get 37k a year in retirement. My retirement and Healthcare are tied to my employer much more loosely than most peoples. I can quit working and still have health care for 6 months. I can go anywhere in the country. I don't do resumes or job interviews. If I want to take a vacation I tell my boss when I won't be in, there is no waiting for it to be approved. If I want to go work somewhere warm for the winter or cool for the summer I can do that. If I decide I'm ready for a new job I quit, without losing benefits, and I take a new job when I'm ready. 


There is a good case to be made for the trades if you're willing to chase trades with good conditions, and you have a good work ethic. Most of it is ignored here because people just don't understand how unions work and either assume trades workers are lying or assume you have to have 10+ years experience to make any real money.",2,1703557047.0,kexqnzd

careerguidance,blue collar,comment,18qvr9h,,"Here is my genuine advice…

Make a list of all the things you have to do, not the things you enjoy like hobbies. List out different homework tasks from school, chores around the house, things you’ve done to help family out. 

Start to put all these forced-tasks into three categories.:

- I absolutely hate it
- it’s fine
- I actually enjoy this

No one enjoys homework. But do you get invested in writing detailed research papers? Do you absolutely hate writing anything for English class, but you really enjoy doing your math homework? 

What about chores - does anything with gross smells cause you to nearly vomit? Maybe you like doing yard work, more than organizing the garage, even when the weather is crap?

Put together this list of tasks that are not fun, they are not your passion. Is there a theme or a thread? Does anything involving math and building something, tolerable? Is anything where you get to be creative and not follow a set plan with a final answer, the best?

Every job has tasks and busy work, you do not want to do. Even somebody that plays video games for a living, still has to put up with bullshit somewhere in the job.

Finding a type of work that centers around forced-tasks that do not drive you crazy, is the way to go. 

I love my career - I could not stand repetitive tasks or my classes where you were essentially doing the same thing you were the day before. I found a career where I get to deep dive into many different things and my attention gets pulled in various directions. I have never had the same day on the job in 15 years. Most accountants or even lawyers cannot say that. 

To narrow your career field, do not focus on what you love to do; focus on what tasks, homework, and chores you can tolerate or even enjoy.",1,1703564781.0,key6ow6

I like helping business that hired blue collar workers like both my grandfather's-men who built our communities. I knew I'd never regret helping them. 

There's no way to fully know what will work out and what won't. Just don't pick a direction because of what someone else thinks-imagine yourself in each industry and see what lights you up. The people I hear regret their career paths the most are the ones that went into a field because someone else told them it was safe or guaranteed success. 

Also, you can go back to school if after a couple years you realize it doesn't work for you. I'm not really sure why everyone thinks they need to make entire life choices so young in life. Full disclosure, I have a BA in Interior Design. Never did any design work in my life. When I finished my degree I hated the wealthy people I would have to work with. So I went into real estate and all those skills made me 10 times more valuable because I saw real estate in a very different way and had exceptional skills on drafting and presentation. From real estate I got into the industry accounting and went back to school for my graduate degree and then a graduate certificate. 

I'm technically an accountant, but I don't use my skills in the typical way. Many of my former classmates in graduate school that went into public accounting or stayed in industry aren't happy because they did it because someone else told them it was a solid industry. I make double what they do, work half the hours and love my work. 

If you want to dig into a more philosophical inspiration to find direction I recommend ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.""

I (23M) am looking to leave my white collar office job for a blue collar job. I currently work back office at a local community bank and have been with this company for the past 3 years. I’m hoping to join an oil refinery in the neighboring town which is 30 minutes away. Over the past year I’ve applied to multiple positions with the refinery ranging from office work to in the field. Last year I was given the opportunity to take the cobra test and interview but wasn’t hired (position is still open). Now a year later I was emailed a time to interview for a different position. I’ve already considered the pros and cons of each job and my spouse and I agree that this would be a life changing opportunity. (Refinery job is a little more than double my current salary, we bought our first home last year and of course have all our bills that we pay, my spouse does not have a high paying job but enjoys what she does so I’ve been okay with taking over a majority of financial responsibility, last but not least we are expecting our first baby in September). 

I have no experience in this industry so I know I’m already at a disadvantage compared to other candidates. Does anybody have any tips/advice on what to say/do to give me the best chances possible to acquire this job? How can I give the new company peace of mind if they hire me given that I have no experience? 

Some of the questions I remember from the previous interview were things like: “How will you prepare to work a dupoint schedule” and “How important is safety to you” etc. Questions like these I struggle with, simply because I feel they would be common sense. I know what needs to be done to ensure these things but I have a hard time giving an appropriate/professional answer to such questions.  

I’m one of those people that will go above and beyond in everything and anything that I do. I know that I can do any task given to me with great quality and efficiency . It’s something I pride myself in but how do I portray myself this way in the little amount of time I have for an interview.

here are my reasons:

leaving white collar:

- lower ceiling (not allowed to get real estate license, harder to use sales skills outside of the bank without it being a conflict of interest)
- if i went back to school to get an accounting/finance degree, it would take over 2 years + more $
- politics/rules: ive been at my bank for 1.5 years, they like me a lot and i got a promotion, but still cannot get full-time hours and pay my bills (the promotion is nice, but full time would make a huge difference)

doing blue-collar:

- huge entrepreneurial aspirations (can start my own company after years of learning the trade)
- trade school is only 6 months, and from being in college ive made connections to people in unions thru friends, etc
- i come from very low income household, and want to get to the money with whichever route is faster honestly
- have worked unskilled blue-collar jobs before and enjoyed it (moving company, etc)
- blue collar *seems* less political and backstabbing, also seems like there is a way higher ceiling for the money to be made (i know of bankers barely cracking 80k within 10 years, vs electricians being well into 6 figures after 10 years, depending on the situation)

any/all advice would be very much appreciated. i dont wanna end up making the wrong decision. i overthink a lot and making a decision on a career is obviously an important thing

careerguidance,blue collar,comment,1c7d8xt,,"My advice is to stick with your criminal justice degree you’ve already worked years for it and can get a decent job I’m assuming so I’ll give my opinion on the points you’ve listed as I’ve been an electrician for 8 years union and non-union 

• it is possible to start your own company but as you mentioned it take years and also there is a lot of competition out there but again it’s possible 

•trade school is good but that 6 months is just a stepping point it takes years to fully grasp what your working towards and even then you’ll always be surprised as all jobs are different and if you have friends In the union you can go straight to the union as they have a school of there own 

• we all do it for the money of course but I see most people quit because it’s no worth it. The physical toll it takes on your body at least in my case your first couple years you’ll be doing grunt work regardless of school lifting heavy shit and doing meticulous things where you think you won’t learn anything as well as getting talked down to even though your green and it wasn’t your fault all while doing this for 10-12 hours a day and depending what trade I hope your not afraid of heights. When you move on up the ladder the physical turns to mental delegating people and meeting deadlines honestly sucks all I dream about now is work. 

• that’s why I do it and love it regardless of all those points I love Building things and seeing what they become in the end and saying I did that. 

• blue collar is less back stabbing because on the site if you have a problem you handle it face to face in my experience there is HR at most company’s but if you go to them no one will respect you or treat you the same unless it’s something major mostly injuries. And on the job you get heated with someone but you just have to know it’s work and you’ll get over it most times. 
There is a high ceiling for the money to be made but it takes years and years of hard work after 7 years I’ve become a foreman but goddam it was exhausting and you tell yourself is it worth it! I can feel my body deteriorating plus if you have people you love you won’t see them from all the hours your working or even worse traveling I see my wife 2 times a week and that’s because I’m lucky right now. 

Look in the end do whatever you want to do im not trying to discourage you from going to the trade I’m just giving insight to my experience and I’ll support anyone who wants to go into the trades as long as the bills are paid and your working. The only reason I said to stick with criminal justice is because you worked years for it. But In the end good luck.

At my current company upper management makes around 150k so it would take 15-20 years to get the that point even I even could at that point! My question is while I am in my mid 20s should I go get an operator job and try to work my way up at a company that makes this much money, or should I stay at my cushy office job? The commute is exactly the same (companies are right besides each other). However, the work is a lot harder at the new company with the shift being 4 on 4 off swing shift. The new company does have great benefits such as close to 50% 401k match and some profit sharing. I do have 2 small kids at home so I am worried to make this transition and losing time with my kids but working at a company making this much with the hopes of moving up the chain one would be life changing money. Any advice/thoughts are appreciated!

Also, I do have family who works at the new company so I know guaranteed I could get a job there if I wanted.",1,1717770756.0,

careerguidance,blue collar,post,1al03yw,Cushy white collar job or intimidating blue collar job?,"I’m in the early process of moving out/buying a house & I’ve been told from many mortgage lenders that my current debt to income ratio is not the best.
I’m at a cushy 9-5 where I currently make 3.2k/monthly post-taxes. My problem is that I’ve hit a pay/experience plateau, work doesn’t get me excited anymore and there doesn’t seem to be any viable growth for me in the future at my job. Pretty much just a cog in the machine. Pros: The only thing that I look forward to are the people - that’s the only reason I’m still there. It is also a white collar job where I work inside and have no worries of working in inclement weather (Midwest). I also feel safe at my job, I have no worries of looking for work & there is job security. Cons: climbing the corporate ladder which makes me super impatient with my future at the company. I see my coworkers who have been there longer & I do not see myself being in their shoes in the future. 

My other option is to go back to work with my father who owns his own plumbing business. I do like what he does & I have the experience in it but it can get pretty lonely/physically draining at times but he makes BANK. The reason I left is because he wasn’t paying me enough for my work. If I were to return back with him I would set clear boundaries to make sure I’m well compensated. Pros: he owns his business which I’ll probably inherit once he retires. Cons: it is daunting considering how much he works & running my own business is scary. Plumbing is a physically demanding trade so my body will be worn down. It is a blue collar career, the environment/people in the field are coarse and insensitive which doesn’t appeal to me. 

Third option: find a different field 

TLDR: keep working at my cushy 9-5 job, with no projected growth in the near future, where I may find it difficult to stay afloat or work in plumbing with my father, which is physically & emotionally more demanding, to earn more money to keep up with my monthly payments.

On the flip side with white collar and why I said blue collar actually cares about those things white collar work just doesn’t really make a lot of sense. Every white collar place I have worked has been political from medium to downright politics every freaking day almost. White collar is downright confusing because I swear to god they don’t seem in it for the effort or money. I’ve seen popularity rule even when it had nothing to do with success. And I’ve even seen several tech companies I’ve worked at fail when they had cultures where the top performers were not given awards or anything then they stand around and can’t seem to understand why the company is going out of business when to me it was so obvious you promote based on who you like. Not on who generates money. It’s like white collar doesn’t understand what business is. Making money. And I get it it is nice if it is more than making money and also has a great culture. But if you have a culture of people who like each other but never make any money then why the hell are you in business?

It’s crazy. Blue collar places as mentioned some of them literally came down to your effort and your results where as I have worked at tech companies that even failed where it seemed they cared more about who they liked even when those people weren’t making them any money and they even failed.

Blue collar quality employers I have witnessed amazingly (can’t believe this is unique) actually were about hard work and results.

That said, I would recommend that you go into welding. Electricians, framers, carpenters, laborers, masons, teamsters, pile butts, rod busters, etc. are a dime a dozen. I don't know much about precision sheet metal workers, but I do know you will be highly sought after if you have a lot of specialized certifications in welding.

Another lucrative option is joining the operator engineers. You could specialize in very large equipment, like cranes or drill rigs. It would take years of training, but if you have the book smarts and a strong work ethic, you could make it there (and get paid a lot) before turning 50.

In general, I highly recommend that you join a union; join the one that interests you the most. Unions take care of their people, and you will have a path to apprenticeships and training programs that you need for advancement.

I dont consider myself to be the smartest/best mechanic out there, but I became one of the ""go to"" guys at that job due to my experience, work ethic, and knowledge. I'm not a dummy. I have a great work ethic. Basically what I'm saying is, I'm pretty competent and a fairly smart fella. 

I had a fuck up that required me to quit my job (lost my driver's license due to a DUI). I've been stone sober since that day. I've decided to give up alcohol for good. I recognize that it was my fault and ive taken full accountability for it.

 Im just in a weird place in life right now though. I have plenty of money set aside to cover schooling and living costs incase I want to go to school for something. I have no wife and i have no kids, I don't own a house. Really I have nothing keeping me in the state I'm in. I could literally do nothing for the next 5 years and still be fine, or I could move across the country and start life over if i really wanted to. I'm constantly trying to learn about new things in this world. Especially in the mechanic and welding world. I've always been the type of guy to go off the beaten path, always been the guy to do wild jobs that ""normal"" people don't do. I just like being different than the average Joe I guess. 

The thing is, IDK what to go back and learn. I don't see myself being a mechanic/welder/fabricator for the rest of my life unless it's a hobby of building hot rods and race cars. I certainly don't want to spend the rest of my life in the Oil patch. I would like a career that pays about or more than what I was making in the Oil patch ($100-$120K). But, I don't think I want to be blue collar anymore.

careerguidance,blue collar,post,1851hf5,"Leaving a white collar career for a blue collar job, bad idea?","Currently I have an office job working in IT. My contract is coming to an end soon, and I'm faced with the prospect of searching for another IT job. Part of me really wants to leave this line of work for a more physical job.

  
I have an opportunity to work a job that is much more physical. It would require a short bit of training to get certified, and to work in all weather conditions. It involves lifting and moving thousands of pounds of material a day. The hours are long, but the job has a 4 day work week, with as much over time as you want. I'm currently in decent shape. I can do 15 chin ups, and ride a bike 50 miles in a day easy, so the physical aspect doesn't scare me.  


  
Pay would be higher than what I make now, and I wouldn't have the stress of running my own LLC. It would however put a stop to my career in IT, and it wouldn't look great on my resume if I ever tried to get back into tech work.

  
If I talk to anyone in my family they tell me to stick with IT, but I don't feel alive in this line of work. I feel like I'm sitting in climate controlled box waiting to retire then die. Maybe it is naive, but I want to do something physical that will have me out in the elements, using my body.

  
Someone close to me commented that the physical job would be mind numbingly boring, but tbh so is this IT work. The physical job would allow me to listen to audio books, and spend my mental energy focused on the things I find interesting, not SQL queries and database schemas.

  
Is this just a case of ""the grass is always greener"" or should I take a shot at this job when my current contract ends?",1,1701086822.0,

It's so much more fulfilling work. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't stuff I miss about my white collar job, but none of it in regards to the actual work. 

Your IT background may seem lost if you switch, but it won't be entirely. Beeing computer literate in the trades makes you a shoe-in for leadership roles which are actually better on the body. 

You can always give it a shot & try it for 6 months to a year without too much repercussions on your IT career. 

White collar jobs aren't what they used to be. They're far from a golden ticket they used to be. There is good earning potential in IT, but so does the trades. Your earning potential will be higher where you'll be most motivated.

It's not a grass is greener type of scenario. It's a preference thing.

 In terms of degrees, certificates, or trade schools; they all take a lot of time. No matter which profession, or knowledge you pursue, you will be starting off on the low end. As for the best ones to have, here's a breakdown based on what I've learned:

1. Trade schools - HVAC, Electrician, Plumbing -best trades to go for. You get an apprenticeship after a bit of time and within roughly 4-10 years you can charge whatever you want to do work. These are the jobs that are needed, since many don't want to do them.
2. Certifications- OSHA, HAZWOPER, GIS, ERSI, WIP - these are there to help boost your knowledge and it does give you an edge when you can successfully incorporate an EAP into your daily functions within a company. I.e. They're great to have, but you need to know why they are important, how they work in tandem with your company and your position.
3. Degrees- IT, Psychology, Healthcare, Science, Legal Studies, STEM, or Management -all of these degrees seem to allow for more payment in terms of a degree, however they only apply if you yourself work to retain the knowledge from them while building yourself up more.

You can make more with or without a piece of paper that says you need this.",4,1718177464.0,l88kxgp

careerguidance,trade school,post,19di8zs,Finding a career? Grad school? Trade school? Fear of future job outlooks?,"I just want a career that brings home a steady paycheck. I know you can technically make a career out of anything, but all the jobs I've worked have seemed temporary, despite all my managers saying that I could go far in the given ""industry"".

I'm a 23M who has a degree in English and graduated in 2021. I thought about grad school before I graduated, but when covid happened I decided to put it on pause and have been working retail ever since.

I've previously worked at a gas station for almost two years (started in undergrad) and was basically a co-manager before leaving. Then I worked as a porter for another year and a half, and I liked it, I really liked the maintenance portion of the job and my supervisor even said that I could go far in that field. Other management wasn't good though and talked about training and promoting me with no actual follow through, so I left.

Now I work at wally world as an overnight stocker. I've only been there for four months, and I like my managers, but I really can't stand the schedule. One manager asked me what I want to do, and said I'm a good worker that could follow his track since he started as a stocker too. He's been there 18 years and makes very good money, but gets sick often because of the stress of the job, and I can't picture myself there for 18 years.

I've been thinking about going back to school, but with the over saturation in the market, I'm so scared that whatever I get my degree in will be tough competition after I get done in a couple years. I'm in the process of applying for grad school (student affairs administration), but I really don't know if it'll be worth it and am scared I'm going to regret it like I regret my undergrad (if I even get in).

I have thought about going for a trade in the past, but I don't know if that'll be good either. I know a lot of people say that there's money in trades, and I think I'd be good at it, but I'm not sure if that's the kind of career I want.

I considered getting a pharmacy tech certification, and staying in that field for a bit to grow experience and such, but when asking other pharmacy techs they say how bad that job is at the retail level and it can be hard to grow out of retail positions, so kind of gave up on that for now.

I'd love to just go to a workplace for a regular M-F working anywhere from 8-7 or whatever, do my work and go home. But overtime and on-call aren't a deal-breaker either. I work hard, I know my experience isn't really fit for office work, which I wouldn't be against that line of work, but I don't think I can compare to competition with previous office experience.

Any advice would be nice. I guess I'm just feeling kind of lost. I thought being an adult was finding one job and sticking with it, which that isn't really how the world works. I know I'm young and have time, but it just feels like the more time I have the more indecisive I get, and with the ever-changing state of our job market it feels impossible to make a plan and stick with it.

I’m currently a tradesperson in Canada and earning 100k CAD working in a power plant. I’m only 25F but I’ve been in the trades since I was 19. Only earning this much in the last 3 years, earlier years I was paid less because of less experience.

I know I’m earning quite well but I am not satisfied in my current position. Here’s why:

• Some days are more backbreaking than others. 

• I work outside in the elements that can get as low as -60 celsius (-76 F) and high as 50 celsius (122 F).

• Sometimes I’m required to carry over 60-70 lbs of heavy acid jugs (can’t use forklift for where they’re gonna be used at).

• I feel weaker than the other men working and feel useless.

• Switching from days to nights constantly results in me sometimes not getting any sleep at all.

Some days though it is pretty chill and relaxed but when it’s busy it’s intense. I also find that I don’t use my brain anymore and just go on autopilot. The reason why I went into trades is that I liked problem solving but couldn’t do that in my job anymore.

I’m going back to school and actually get into proper engineering. I have a total of 70k CAD saved up. I’m moving back in with my parents for 6 months to save on rent while I relearn physics, chemistry, math, calculus, and delve more into robotics. I’m studying physics rn and just feel more alive than when I’m at work. I’m very excited to start learning more about electronics and robotics, I never got the chance to before because it wasn’t offered at my local high school.

Am I making the right call? 

What’s still keeping me from this job is simply the money. I feel like I haven’t saved up enough money to go through college since I’ll be living in British Columbia (average of 1k rent for a studio apartment). I can definitely do student loans but I’m kinda worried about taking out too much. I also have car payments to make, still 24k in balance - I’m debating on selling it off and just use public transportation, I bought it new thinking I’ll be okay paying it off because I had a job (bad choice, I know).

careerguidance,skilled trade,comment,1bywf8f,,"Yes I've changed careers. Yes it was worth it. But doesn't mean it would be for you. Your case for making a change is compelling (the work isn't very engaging and is physically demanding to an extent you may not be able to do it the way it's expected). You have properly identified the crux of the issue: you're well paid, and a career changing path would mean almost certainly giving that up, maybe for a few years, to live the life of a student. However in your favor is that your target career path would also pay well, and you've already demonstrated technical aptitude. To be making the most complete decision possible though I would at least look into something more incremental, like  college engineering programs (generally 3 years, cheaper, less need for math and physics) instead? I don't know about BC, but here in Ontario these tend to be pretty good programs and you might be doing co-op, getting paid in as little as 8 to 12 months too. 

If the BS Engineering is your chosen path, you'll need to budget it out, probably get rid of the car or trade it in for something crappier just to get rid of the loan.

I work for a medium, fast growing aerospace and precision manufacturing company.  I came here with literally zero experience in CNC and worked in an entry level finishing operation for my first year before requesting to train in CNC.  My company has a fairly reputable in house class for the department so I went over and have been there for about 3 months now working in precision milling.  

My boss approached me towards the second half of my shift Friday and offered me a managers position back in finishing overseeing the same production I worked in for my first year.  To be clear, I am extremely flattered by this gesture and am grateful that I would be considered after my short tenure with the company.  This position would bump me from $25 and hour to $30 and also put me in a low-mid managerial position within the firm.  

Now for my questions.  This may sound obtuse or eccentric to some, and the answer may be obvious, but I enjoy CNC so far.  I find numerical operations in its early stages to be extremely satisfying and engaging.  Changing to this position would put that training on hold, unless I took an external class at a community college or Uni.  I am currently 31 years old.  I am confident that in at least 2-3 years I would be closing in on the $30 an hour mark what with the pace of training sign offs and how it works, and I’m picking this stuff up quickly to boot.  My boss thinks I would be a good fit for management though.  Do I put my training on hold, pursue management and someday ask to return to CNC?

I (F26) am currently struggling with trying to figure out what kind of career to pursue. I'll be brief because I don't want to accidentally break subreddit rule #6.

I'm interested in making the world a better place by piloting eco-friendly technology. I've thought about getting into fields that would allow me to innovate solutions to help combat the effects of global warming, improve food security, pilot green energy infrastructure, and - for the most part - spend my working days doing my part to make the world a better place. Ever since a bad experience nearly cost me my life, I've wanted to at least try to give our pale blue dot a fighting chance.

BUT, All of the above costs time and money. I'm not Elon, Zuck, or Besos, so I have none of these things. College Tuition is extremely expensive and grants/loans/scholarships always have strings attached. Also, there are zero guarantees that I'll be able to get a job in a Green Technology Field.

Where I'm from, if you enter a skilled trade, you get paid during your apprenticeship, and then you get paid once you graduate and start working. If I was to take this route, I'd pursue an electrician apprentice, and even though my dreams of making the better place would be thrown into the trash, I'd (hopefully) be making a sh\*t ton of cash.

 Hi everyone. I’m a international graduate student doing film studies in Canada. I describe myself as fairly artistic, I do photography as a hobby and I made 3 short films so far. They didn’t go anywhere but I kind enjoy the process of filmmaking. People describe me as compassionate and having unique thinking. I tend to also enjoy conversations with random strangers. I hold a teaching assistantship in school and I also teach English in my spare time. Education is also something I greatly enjoy.

However, I still can’t help but feel lost about my future. I know I don’t want to do a doctorate degree. Academic life doesn’t fit me. I hate sitting in the library all day to read. I’m generally curious about a lot of things, but I simply just don’t want to bury myself with academic papers. It’s quite lonely too. Through my first year in grad school I realize I enjoy interacting with real people.  

That brings me to my question: my next move. I’m thinking of learning a few skills in the summer. So far I have editing, photoshopping, color grading in mind. I want to systematically improve my filmmaking skills and to be able to make short videos at ease. But I’m also stressed thinking maybe I should learn something like Web design or game design, which are more employment-ready? (I should mention I am fairly critical of media in general and I think and write a lot on them)

I'd highly recommend avoiding trade schools at all costs. They'll eat up your GI bill and you'll start at the same place you would without them. I'd highly recommend looking for union apprenticeships. You can use your gi bill during an apprenticeship and it'll pay bah for your area with 2 dependants. For guys in my union this works put to be journeyman rate from day 1. Keep in mind that with most union trades you won't be paying for health care or retirement at all. Voc rehab is also an option depending on your rating/mos, it's generally a better option than using the gi bill, but is harder to get. 


Elevator Mechanic: heavily unionized trade, difficult to get into, but best pay and benefits around. 

HVAC Tech: look into Tin knockers, sheet metal workers, and plumbing unions 

Welder look into Iron workers, boiler makers, plumbers and pipe fitters unions

You're asking HOW to switch, not WHAT to switch to, so I'll focus on that.

First, take stock of your financial situation. Understand how much it costs to live your life, and what your safety net (if any) offers you. Figure out financially how long you can go without a source of income, or with a partial source of income. This is important because you can't just snap your fingers and join a different job. You have to TRAIN first, and cover your bills while you do.

Then take an inventory about what you LIKE and what you HATE about your job. You already mentioned low pay and pressure, what are the other things that make you want to quit? This will help you think about what other sorts of jobs you know you'd like or at least tolerate, versus ones you'll just end up disliking too.

Next, look at your proven assets. What do you do well? What do you not do well? As an example, some people find it easy to focus and sit down and work and then BAM their workday is over, while others really struggle with even just sitting down for half an hour. Which one are you?

This second and third item together will help you identify jobs that you can personally be successful in. They won't necessarily help you GET such jobs, but they will help you avoid ones that really aren't for you.

So now that you know what might work if you can get it, investigate what jobs are hot and what funded training options are available in your area. (Someone already mentioned bootcamps are not a good idea, and I agree.) Are there companies that are seeking apprentices at low wages but with the potential for rapid growth? Does your local government offer training programs for people trying to get into a field? Do you have a regional politician that you could have a conversation with and see what they might be aware of? Got any strings to pull in your circle of friends and relatives?

Ended up switching schools and obtained a 2 year associate in applied science in power and control technology from Oklahoma State Tech.

Started out as an industrial electrician, quickly moved into the utility arena, (power grid stuff, generation and transmission substation work, NOT a lineman job).

Primarily have handled protection, control, scada, automation and communication testing, checkout and commissioning of new substations my entire 39 years. Have only had 3 employers since ‘85.

Have always been in the top 10% of earners in the USA, excellent benefits, vacation, sick time, pension and 401k, company trucks, and freedom to run my own show as long as budgets and schedules are met.
Have had the joy of working in 36 of our 50 states, met tons of good people, got to see a lot of the country, and have always had fun at it.

Currently making around $225k annually and I am very well set up for retirement.
Our field service techs generally make more than our EE’s in the office because the skill set is so in demand and the hiring pool is pretty small.

It’s been a good life and I have zero regrets.

As the title says i’m an electrician, who just so happens to be 7 feet tall. I find my job very stressful due to the amount of pressure and knowledge we are supposed to have. Even though i’m only in my mid twenties. 

I’v been thinking about a career change to something less stressful and could use my height for. Such as close protection/bodyguard work. (I know i should of got into basketball but i’m 25 now and it never really interested me)

Any career/life advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks Guys",135,1705873835.0,

careerguidance,electrician,comment,19cevdf,,"All construction and technical jobs operate on the ""stick up the ass"" principle so bad luck if you can't deal with that. Long hours, expectation to always overperform, and of course, be cheap too, because if you're not, someone else will immediately undercut you. Doesn't matter what you do really, it's every job in the field.

No job particularly benefits from height. Yeah you could be a bouncer for a random bar that just wants someone who looks intimidating but that's not a real career. Security/protection value other qualities much more than just looking intimidating, and it's a bit hard to get into, it's a closed circle. 

I'd say maybe pursue some further education in the automotive field and maybe jump over to doing electrical work on cars or working on electric cars which is a booming business and most current mechanics are not equipped to work on them. Those jobs still have the stick up the ass but at least they're far more relaxed and less physically demanding compared to doing electrical work in buildings and slithering around tight spaces. 

If you want to make good money pivot towards construction equipment. Cranes, elevators (construction or commercial), generators, all have much better pay.

1. It's not your height that will give you an advantage.  It's your weight, build and overall strength.
2. The career field is not less stressful if you're working for someone who can afford to pay you.

Most of the work is going to be easy, especially if people are going to be intimidated by your size.  
However, if you run in to a motivated or trained person and you are not also trained; your height will not save you from getting your ass kicked.

Were I you, and I half expect someone to say this in the thread already, I'd look in to commercial and residential painting while you figure out if you want to take on about 24 months of intensive small arms and hand to hand training; then get on with a security company.

If you choose to go that way, the military may be a solid choice for career until you get to about 30 years of age.  Choose a 31 or 11 career path and get some training then figure out things.

Electrical construction is one of the hardest fields I've ever worked in, the work is grueling, it's very hard on the body, I've been slowly stacking injuries the last several years, and many times the work environments can be very toxic to new people getting in amd learning.

careerguidance,electrician,post,1d5bukm,Pilot or Electrician?,"Hi everyone! I’m at a crossroads of what career path I should embark on and wanted to get some second opinions. For the past 6-7 months I have been aiming to try to get into the electrical union here in the states but I’m feeling a bit conflicted. For reference I’m in my early 20s, and feeling pretty lost and behind the curve. I had previously taken some local college classes to get into a good school but had realized that I really had no end goal and war more so looking to go to school for the experience rather than for a particular career path. I then made the decision to change course and do whatever it takes to get into the electrical union, which I have not as applications have not yet opened to the closest local. Over the years I had always had thoughts of how incredible and exciting it would be to have a career as an airline pilot, but got discouraged by people telling me chances getting a spot are incredibly low and that I could easily lose my job if I did get in with a legacy airline eventually in the case of a recession or similar. I have never been in the cockpit before but I always enjoyed traveling internationally or domestically throughout my life and absolutely love the idea of being responsible for flying people around and having that breathtaking view and feeling of freedom every working day. I plan to book a “discovery” flight soon to see what it’s like first hand but wanted to get some opinions from others here. To me the most important things in a career would be work life balance, fulfillment, comfortable salary and ability to travel/take time off. I’ll list out some pros and cons for each. If you’ve read this far, thanks for bearing with me!

Union electrical:
(Pros)
-Work with some really cool and interesting people 

-Master a skill that will always be needed 

-freedom to take plenty of time off (after 5 years) to travel the world/country and work on my many hobbies

-very good pay (+\- 100k without OT)

-fantastic benefits/pensions

-diverse workload, always something new to do/learn

-physically challenging work to keep me in shape

-get to come home every night (unless traveling for work)

-can move to another part of the country

-guaranteed salary after 5 year apprenticeship

(Cons)
- very long commutes 

-work can dry up certain times of year or due to economic reasons 

-physical work can cause damage to the body after many years even with a healthy lifestyle

-more dangerous, could get killed/badly injured on duty which would also hurt my career prospect 

-presumably less enjoyable/fulfilling work

-more of a toxic environment

-less than ideal working conditions 

Pilot:
(Pros)
-work seems incredibly fulfilling/engaging 

-ability to travel

-great benefits/pay (after many years)

-far more interesting to me

-flexible schedule (after many years)

-no risk of physical harm if healthy diet/exercise are maintained 

-will always be in demand (except in bad economic situations)

-flying seems fantastic

-become an expert in all things aviation and build relationships with others in the field 

-I’m incredibly grateful to be in a situation where the costs (VERY high) would be covered by family, which are is incredibly rare and lucky for me.

(Cons)
-volatile industry 

-could take very long to get a spot with a good airline, or could even never happen if I were unlucky depending on demand 

-away from home often and for long periods (especially in the early years) 

-less time for hobbies, time away from future family, unable to do things like join a band or have pets for many years 

-can get lonely 

-missing out on friend or family events due to unpredictable schedule 

-would likely put strain on relationships with SO and friends 

-could lose position with legacy airline if economic crisis occurs which would erase any and all seniority/bring me back to square one 

-have to work extra hard on physical fitness and diet 

-unseen health problems could cost my career, regulations are very strict

I'm 23 and recently discovered my interest in pursuing a career as an electrician, and I'm really excited about it. I'm currently in Manitoba but plan to move back to Ontario by the end of 2025. I'm thinking about starting my journey into the electrician trade here in Manitoba before heading back. However, I have a few questions and could really use some advice.

Firstly, I'm completely new to the trade world, specifically in the realm of electrical work. I don't even know where to begin. I'm not sure what steps I need to take to get started as an electrician or what qualifications I'll need. Any guidance on how to approach this decision and initiate my journey would be immensely helpful.

Additionally, I'm curious about the work-life balance as an electrician. I've heard various perspectives, and I want to ensure I'm prepared for what lies ahead. Can anyone share their experiences or offer insights into what to expect in terms of work hours and lifestyle as an electrician?

Lastly, I'm aware that trade qualifications can differ between provinces. How would starting my apprenticeship in Manitoba and then moving to Ontario affect my journey as an electrician? Are there any specific steps I should take to ensure a smooth transition between provinces?

I'd appreciate any advice, tips, or resources you all can provide, especially related to becoming an electrician. Thanks in advance for your help!

It seems like it will be very hard to find a job with an engineering degree. Meanwhile, you can get into an electrician union if you put in the effort. Maybe not guaranteed but it seems more realistic.

if we were to look at the ability to find a job (and that's assuming effort is put into going to internships, general experience, etc.), which career would be more worth it in today's job market? I will consider switching between the two depending on what things happen. ",0,1713976330.0,

True, the trades offer a quicker path to get to the job market and in early years with over time you might even make more money than an engineer, but the physical effort, job related risks, and conflicts with management are significantly larger for electricians than engineers.

Engineering is always a high demand position, and not sure why you claim there’s a tight job market for mechanical or electrical engineers when companies recruit thousands of them every year. Yes, takes longer to finish the degree, but it has better long term prospects in my opinion.

careerguidance,electrician,comment,1cc2pmo,,"I got a civil engineering degree, did that for a few years, then became a pilot.  In virtually every endeavor, the engineering degree has been beneficial, both in getting an edge over my peers and in helping me learn new tasks and understand the underlying theory.  The degree opens a lot of doors that aren’t even necessarily related to engineering.  I also routinely use my construction experience in my personal life, which has roughly doubled my net worth and vastly increased my personal quality of life.  

The dirty secret is that the only ones who make a lot of money in engineering or trades are the business owners.  If you want a salary engineering job, you’ll end up with the golden hand cuffs where you get paid too well to leave, but you work too hard to really enjoy life or start your own business.  You’ll get paid $150k to make someone else millions. As an engineer you’ll have a framework to problem solve quantifiably with math and a solid understanding of most sciences that will give you an edge in just about any business venture.

Also, at least at my university, it seemed like As were average for most other degrees, but Cs were average for engineers, and that was after the crazy high washout rates in lower division classes.  So you need to have thick skin and accept that routinely pulling all-nighters and working the hardest you’ve ever worked, may result in a C.  The professors can  really make or break the class; they can make the most difficult subject easy and vice versa.  If you can get an engineering degree, absolutely get it, but realize it’s going to be a lot of hard work and discipline.  After getting the degree, you’ll still need real world experience to tie the theory to the practical, but there are very few people who can truly bridge that gap and an engineering degree gives you the tools to do that across a wide spectrum of subjects.",1,1713981080.0,l12sh59

My parents were against it because this field was very competitive and it had no real security to it so I listened to them and went on to study electrical engineering in college but had no interest in it whatsoever. I planned to study as an apprentice while I pursued acting on the side and being an electrician eliminates all the worries I have in terms of finance, job security, and a comfortable life while allowing me to continue acting without worry. I soon realized that being an apprentice requires a lot more of your time and attention which leaves very little time (and energy) to focus on acting stuff like memorizing scripts, rehearsing, doing research, attending auditions, etc. I have heard countless times that as an actor, you spend more time on auditions and callbacks than actually working which is why I feel I should have a second option readily available but as I mentioned above, this option is quite demanding that it often overshadows the acting side. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know which direction to go and would appreciate any advice or perspectives on this situation.

TV, movies, commercials, stage/theatre, what?  

Tons of stuff films in Canada: movies, Hallmark movies and specials, most of what's on the CW now, some of what's on the American networks now, Lifetime movies, so on.  So there are opportunities but like Hollywood, most of the good parts that lead to making a steady living often go to the known/""name"" actors there (just watch any TV show filmed in Canada and for the most part, you'll see the same actors pop up repeatedly).  So there is some insularity and nepotism, either that or they have a very small pool of actors that do each role.  

The other thing is most of the opportunities for TV and movies are in Vancouver (north Vancouver, also known as the Hollywood of Canada) with a few in Toronto and Montreal (CBS's hit comedy Ghosts films there).  I don't know about theatre work.  So it's very likely that unless you want to move to one of those cities - I'd recommend Vancouver - you won't work enough to make a steady living even if you get a foot in the door.  And from what I've heard, Vancouver is hella expensive.

If you really want to do this, I'd recommend becoming a full-fledged electrician, get a good job in Vancouver and move there and try to do acting on the side - see if you can get an agent, maybe start with minor parts like extra work, commercial auditions, etc.  If the acting takes off, great, go for bigger roles, if not, at least you have the electrician work to fall back on (maybe there is electrician work on sets, so I'd look into that, too).",2,1708292447.0,kr1qnxk

Another thing, if you do need to work full time as an electrician to survive you won't get much time off to go to auditions unless you keep taking time off (and if you do it too much, you risk losing your day job).

I (22) am a (going into 2nd year) Electrical Apprentice really contemplating making the switch to Electrical Engineering.

I went to school for electrical engineering for about a year and it was the best time I’ve had learning about a topic. I had to leave however since the cost of going to school would be too expensive and I had no help paying for it and didn’t want to take out a loan. 

So fast forward about it a year and a half and I got a job as an electrician apprentice (non union). I am fortunate to have a good position in my company as I am a JSA/lead. I like the work I do. I am not crazy about my company but I make the most out of it and am grateful for where I am. But, I feel like something is missing. I love working with my hands and am naturally very energetic, however, I feel as if I there is something missing and it’s that I miss that EE life. I love exercising my mind when working and I just don’t feel that stimulated when working. I know I’m only in my 1st going into 2nd year and troubleshooting might be later down the line. But there is just something about my heart that misses EE. 

So I am thinking of going back to school. My ideal plan is to get a job doing some 2nd shift job doing some data work that pays more than what I am making currently (which isn’t a lot at all) and going to school during the day. Or finding a school that has night school for engineering courses and I could work during the day. I have worked while attending school full time and I’m used to it. 
My only drawback is I have a little doubt in my mind that the grass won’t be greener and that a couple of factors are influencing how I feel:
1. My company overall isn’t good to work for a pays us far below what others (even non union) get. 
2. I see everyone graduating college and it makes me feel somewhat behind. 
3. I have switched majors and career paths more than half a dozen times and it feels like I would be back to doing that. 

So to conclude my monologue, I’m not sure what I want. Everyone I know that I would ask this to isn’t really in tune with the fields so I just get some variation of “do what you think is best.” I guess I am looking for some hard opinions. Either way.

However, I have applied to an “apprentice” role before and studied what it takes in my state (southern USA), to eventually get a license and become a master electrician.  With your current role being so different, and I assume you have no experience at all with electricity, or tools, or hands-on skills, you have to factor in the time, cost of initial investment, and your overall goal when you become an electrician. Most trade schools will work with you to place you into an apprentice role, on residential or commercial jobs. I would recommend as an adult who is into his career, to consider an apprentice role, instead of trade school, and do that for a few years. That way you can get some real world experience, while working towards a journeyman license. If you can join the union in your locality , do it. Commercial electricians can make anywhere from 45k-65k for entry-level, and upwards of 100k for master electricians. Commercial electricians make the most money. If you do it for the reason of money, you will not be satisfied. If you love solving problems, studying electrical components and working in panels, , and/or seeing your work help commercial or residential spaces have lights and power, then it’s a field I’d consider.

careerguidance,electrician,comment,17su1t3,,"Once upon a time I was in your shoes. I was in a union for a minute for HVAC. I had some different opportunities present themselves, I went with those and now I'm a non union electrician. If you get into a union and stick it out you'll pretty much always have work especially if you go with industrial or commercial. Even if you're a bad worker there'll always have a big job pop up that they need bodies for. Also, as a laborer you'll make more and have great benefits. I currently have to use my wife for benefits. You'll also get a pension with a union, and a lot less stress about retirement and investments. 

All that being said non union you definitely have more freedom. A lot less corporate BS, and political BS. Not that non union doesn't have BS just different BS, less red tape. Freedom wise, I was able to very quickly use my quality of work and knowledge to leverage my pay, time off and jobs I take on. It's also a lot easier to say ""No"" when asked to work overtime, weekends or holidays. If you're good enough you'll be able to negotiate in those instances. My work life balance is so much better than when I was in a union and that's something I didn't even consider when I jumped ship. If you're lucky, you can have a similar experience in a small union shop. Being non union your quality of work has to be next level because everyone will be looking over your work though a lens. You'll be judged by inspectors before they even get to the site. Although, it's not hard to have good, clean, up to code work and have it look better than the other guys these days. Quality in all the trades is all over the place right now. If you plan on having your own business you can definitely make more money non union and be way more flexible on jobs. Although, you'll probably have to stick to residential work, depending on your area.

Hope this helps. Good luck getting into IBEW, if you can. If you're dead set on getting in it helps to know people who are already in and can vouch for you. You can also look around for shops that need laborers, they can sponsor you. I had to do both to get into my aforementioned union. Well, that's how I got to the point of being allowed to take the tests (written and piss).

Lots of people who end up with I.T. degrees do not end up with a six figure salary. And it’s not for lack of education as much as it is for lack of the willingness to continually learn and train to keep relevant. Desk jobs are not all they are cracked up to be either. So depending on what type of I.T. work you wish to pursue, keep in mind that you also have a big difference in physically what you will have to do during your day.

careerguidance,plumber,comment,1d01fzo,,"Think about your body. I was in a similar situation. My dad is a big rig driver making 100k+ but with a lot of overtime and wear and tear on the body. I worked at the company he worked for, driving a forklift since I was 18. By the time I was 27 I had maxed out the pay for a forklift driver and the only route to make more was to become an on the road big rig driver with a class A. I would make $28/hr to start. Only thing is I HATE driving and sitting in traffic.

I took a 6 months break from that job with my savings and of course my father's support with the house and everything else. I studied my ass off and got some basic IT certs. (comptia A+, AWS CCP, and Sec+).  This allowed me to get a job (no degree), as help desk technician for a local MSP, and a pay cut.

Now two years later, I switched companies and work remotely as a Systems Administrator. Not client facing, and mainly Azure/AWS work. Making the equivalent to $38 hour on a salary.

careerguidance,plumber,comment,1d01fzo,,"I’m an IT director, and I’ve had to let people go in the past because “they always enjoyed and were good with computers”. If it’s a hobby, and not something you’re legitimately passionate about or are prepared to dedicate a significant amount of your life to the field, I strongly suggest against getting into IT. 

Entry level is brutal right now. Everyone has little to no experience, with a feeble hobby passion, and the same 3 overplayed certs. On top of that the on the job learning curve is very steep, and the pace can be very fast at times. Add in the expectation that you will constantly be applying yourself to learn and develop yourself after hours, and you will discover that if your passion was only at the hobby level you will only have a few options: burn out and move to another career, burn out and never make it beyond early/mid level because that’s about all you can muster, or get fired. Sometimes the days can be long and difficult and just liking computers isn’t enough. There’s going to be a point where the difference between getting a better job or not comes down to “were you interested and curious enough to take your education into your own hands and learn what you couldn’t learn at work on your own home lab?”

Edit: I forgot the part about salary.  Entry level is abyssal for pay. Depending on where you live, where you would work, and other similar factors, the range for entry level ranges from about $40k - $65k. People in California and New York will tell you their helpdesk jobs net them $80k-100k, anywhere else but those and similar places that’s completely insane and unrealistic.",1,1716626899.0,l5l8a7g

A website where your customers can easily book services, pay invoices, see photos of completed jobs, etc will go a long way.

My brother in law and I started our careers around the same time. I'm IT, he is a plumber.  I've done very well and I'm now a leader in my company. My Brother in law has also done very well in his field, he is not a service plumber, only does new structure and the occasional hot water tank because they are super easy.

Compensation

Based solely on salary we make very close to the same, however, his potential earnings are almost double mine. I get bonuses based on how well the company did in the year, his commission structure is based on the projects he completes. He does everything from scoping, quoting, ordering, and implementation. Completing one project might net him the same amount in commission that I would earn on my yearly bonus. On top of that he has as many side jobs as he wants, we live close to some lakes where rich people like to build vacation and retirement homes.

Work Life

Mine is far better, standard 9-5 and I only get the occasional ping on off hours with maybe once or twice a year ""all hands"" moments.  He will work 60 days straight, 10-16 hour days, drives long distance and may have to sleep away from family.

Perceived Value

The public has a much higher value for plumbing, everyone understands the need, but has very little insight to the cost.  They pay what ever is written on the quote, its absurd the amount he has to charge if he DOES NOT want the job.  I'm talking 5-10 times the cost of sale, and they still pay sometimes, he has very little competition. On the contrary, very very few have a high value for IT, they know they need it, but you can basically get IT from anywhere in the world right now.

careerguidance,plumber,comment,1d01fzo,,"You can still work in plumbing and then move on to IT. I’ve worked in construction for some years, and am moving to IT at the age of 31, and my time in construction is very valuable to me. I am glad I took that path.

Man, I used to feel so rushed and think that I had to get into a good/respected career quickly and hurry to climb the ladder, buy a house, invest, etc etc. But as I get older, and hopefully wiser, I think, what the hell man, do whatever you want. Live dangerously, screw the safe path.  Even if you go into plumbing, you will be working, saving money, learning how to handle it. You’ll learn a lot. Perhaps even that you don’t want to get into IT. You’ll be learning about life, you’re maturing and still socialising. I realise now that I didn’t start to socialise until my late 20s, when I started working on it actively, and not passively as we often do at a young age. Accepting people as they are, learning how to deal with difficult social interactions correctly, etc. 

The value of a good relationship with your father exceeds anything materialistic, like money, status, or achievements. I think anyone who is wise will agree. Unless you develop into a hollow man, I don’t think you’ll ever think back “I wish I had started my career sooner and became more successful”, it is very likely though that you’ll think “I wish I had spent more time or effort into my relationship with my father”.

But, it needs to be said, there are other ways to improve your relationship with your father. You may still go into IT and spend more time and effort into the relationship. You can also study while being a plumber.. What does your gut tell you? Be with yourself for a while, take some time and listen. Wish you well.",1,1716680649.0,l5ofd6i

My kids will work, learn and develop into functioning, capable people ""safely."" They will have the freedom to be imperfect while obtaining their own way into the world. Our culture has divided us, and has us believing that kids leave home as soon as they are able is the goal. Extended families and the village of support it offers is scoffed at. (Look at hispanic culture; they are more often very tight family units that work together.)

I'll add that the wealthy and rich all have trust and estates, they bequeth assets, knowledge, opportunities to their children. The poor fall behind because we are taught nepotism is evil.

You have an opportunity, with your father. Don't put him on a pedestal, don't be afraid to think outside his views, and grow, try things he has not or won't do. Then work to surpass him, in a fun comradery sort of way. Then, maybe he managed 135K on his own, would that salary increase with you by his side? The possibility is not zero%.



In regards to plumbing vs IT.

The skills you obtain in plumbing general transfer from all plumbing businesses, country to country, etc (water is water, pipes are pipes, everywhere. And everyone needs to drink, clean themselves and poop.)

IT, in my opinion and experience, can be proprietary and lead to certain ""dead-ends"" if you are not careful. You can become a master python programmer, but then 10 years from now, the industry has sunsetted that language.

Both career paths have an un-known ceiling on potential income, partially determined by creativity, and who and what you know.

If you go the IT path, you especially need to exercise regularly and eat well. Plumbing is going to keep you more active on the regular, but can also destroy your body if you try and show off and be ""manly.""

So ultimately, you can make a life from either choice. You can also do more than one career. Live your life for experiences and leave little room for regrets. This is the only one we have.

Good luck to you!",1,1716653383.0,l5mm1rr

careerguidance,plumber,post,1c5lrxa,What career path should I take as an apprentice plumber at a lucrative job?,I (24m) am an apprentice plumber with about 2 more months to get my residential license. I got into an extremely lucrative position and make about 120k a year. I am wondering what the next steps in my career should be. My job pays more than most master plumbers make in my area but I'm scared that something will happen with the company or the market that will make this unsustainable. Should I consider getting into a different area like engineering or is there another carrier path that can benefit from my plumbing experience that I should work towards instead? Thanks for any advice! ,3,1713288123.0,
careerguidance,plumber,comment,1c5lrxa,,"At the risk of stating the obvious…stay the course and get your journeyman’s license in 2 months.

A little less obvious, I would never give up money now on the chance it might go away later. Figure out what “base pay” you can make as a generalist if your specialty goes away. Re-arrange your finances so that you live off the generalist’s pay. Invest the premium you make as a specialist. You can invest it in a retirement account, in a house, or in getting your own truck and tools—or even just in a high-yield savings account to give you options and a bit of interest—but the point is to have the extra money either make your life easier (now or in retirement) or help you pivot if your specialty dissolves. (There’s a good chance your specialty comes back, too, so remember that.)

Engineers start around $70k, after 4 years of school. Many are not at $120k after 10 years of experience. Those that are at $120k within 10 years usually job-hopped and moved every 2-3 years for a pay increase. (I’ll note that engineers usually have good benefits from their jobs.) In short, don’t quit plumbing because you think engineering will bring more money—if you are suddenly making significantly less, that would be the right time to consider if engineering school will bring a greater return.

Hello, I went back to college at age 21 after 6 years in the work force (resturaunt, SPED, general contracting, landscaping) more or less for my family. I am 25 now, and I am about to graduate with my bachelors in Computer Science with an emphasis in Cyber-Security. I have several cyber-security certifications but can’t find jobs or internships that will even look at my professional resume. I am starting to doubt that it’s possible to break into the tech industry without experience. I have all the certs but no security clearances. Would it be worth it to become a plumber or HVAC apprentice for a few years and gain some practical skills that are more recession/AI proof? I honestly think that cybersecurity has been over-advertised with all these boot camps and certifications, when I am about to have a whole bachelors degree and several “job placement” certs but won’t even get a look from employers. I have solid  transferable skills like communications and an excellent job history(never fired). I wouldn’t mind the hard work.

careerguidance,plumber,post,1774dxl,Company is asking me to buy my own van for an apprentice plumber job before my 8 weeks of training are up. Is it worth the investment?,"Just for context, I very recently bought a car about  4 months ago. This car I got was the first car i have ever owned and I made the decision to buy it in order for me to have better opportunities for better jobs that may require driving or a license such as a trade job that would obviously require a lot of travel to customers houses. However, I did not take into consideration a company would actually require me to by my own Van/truck rather than have it company supplied.

&#x200B;

The apprentice plumber job I am applying to has 8 weeks of paid training as well as school lessons for the trade once a week where i am getting fairly low pay since its just training. But Before those 8 weeks are up I am required to buy my own Van 15 years of age or newer. My financial situation is not the greatest in terms of my salary, and my current job doesn't lead to anywhere which is exactly why i want to get into a Trade to at least learn a skill and better my Financial position.  But the thought of buying another vehicle is pretty daunting and a stressful thought. I am not exactly struggling and the only debt i have is on the recent car i bought, but I am wondering if it is a good decision to buy this van for this company and just hope it pays off or stay where I am in a job that pays very low unless I hit OT for 100-110+ hours a pay period in which case it becomes ""normal"" pay. I can potentially wait 6 months to a year and save up for a van to buy outright, but this opportunity may be missed if i do that. Im not exactly old, but im not young anymore either. I just hit 34 and I feel like ive already wasted enough time in my life to find a good career and don't want to waste anymore.

The hiring manager who contacted me assured me that once my 8 weeks are up i can ""easily afford to pay off the van"" because its commission based, but I have a hard time trusting that given the fact that ive pretty much been a low income earner all my life. Can anyone give thoughts and advice for this situation I'm in?


Edit: thanks for the responses! I actually didn't think it would be a overwhelmingly ""NO!"" Across the board, but it only confirms my hesitation with them in the first place.  I'm not going to bash on them as a company and the guy I talked to was very nice, however I can't justify the price of a van that I own with someone else's logo on it. That's why I made this post, to confirm that my hesitation was correct or if it was normal to buy my own van in plumbing while working for someone else.  Further more it's commissions based,  so I'd be more of a salesman than anything it seems. Even best buy provides their own vans for geek squad.

Some basic tools, yes, but the person you're apprenticing to is *responsible* for you & your work, and that includes a reasonable way to get you there when needed, and reasonable access to expensive or specialized tools when needed.

So I am currently 31, married and have 2 kids. My current job I make about $75k and only work around 35 hours a week. It’s a great job, good pay, and great time off. (All holidays and multiple weeks vacation).

But it’s very unrewarding. I find no joy in it and I have no desire to advance any further in this company. I’ve stayed for a long time (11 years) because it allows me a lot of freedom outside of work. 

But I’m wanting to change to a job that actually provides value. The main 2 I look at are becoming a  plumber and electrician. Both provide value to the community, plus it would be nice to be able to be skilled in either of these trades to help out family when they need it. 

I’ve looked at salaries for both these and it looks like they can start much lower than what I’m making, which has me worried. My wife stays home, and with recent price increases we are already barely getting by. Our kids are young so my wife and I are not really wanting her to get a job yet.

My main question is, is it possible to get a part time job as an electrician or plumber? While I’m at a lower pay for the trade, i would be willing to keep working my job now, then work the plumbing or electrician job in the evenings or weekends. Once I’m making enough to support my family I would go full time as a plumber or electrician.

Hey everyone. I wanted some advice on this as I have been having an internal battle with myself for a couple months now. Maybe some of you were in my shoes at one point. 

I am 23 years old and graduated college in may with a bachelors degree in Business administration with a focus in sales and marketing. Right after graduation I landed a pretty good entry level sales engineer job. Making pretty decent money for a kid fresh out of college. Car allowance and full benefits. While I have not been in this role too long I feel myself disliking the corporate environment. I don’t like the office chit chat and small talk. The job in itself isn’t too bad I make cold calls until I build up my territory to go visit clients. I understand the hardest part of the job is the first year and it’s not the work I’m worried about it’s the environment. 

All through Highschool and summers in college I worked as a carpenter, landscaper, or plumbers “apprentice”. I always liked the grind and working with my hands and figuring things out. I worked with a plumber for a year and he tried to talk me out of college because I was picking it up quickly. In college I started a business doing odd jobs and moving. In 2 weeks I had more work than I could handle. The year and a half I ran that small college business was the best experience I had. I have always wanted to own my own business and I don’t think staying in the sales world would ever allow for that. I am a very hard worker especially when it comes to labor. 

What do you think? is it too late for me to become a plumber? Have I invested too much money into school to not use my degree? Any advice would be appreciated. Let me know if any additional details are needed.

careerguidance,plumber,comment,199bvyw,,"I know you’re asking OP but I thought I’d chime in. 

It really depends on 2 factors, where you are geographically, and if you’re non union vs union. 

I’ll never trash someone who’s non union, but 9.5 times out of 10 union pays much better with better benefits and pension. I’m 25m, a union journeyman Boilermaker welder and also master rigger. My base hourly wage is $52.07/hr and about $80/hr total wage package. Anything after 8hrs on weekdays, Saturday, Sunday and holidays is all double time. After 10hrs you get a hot meal paid for, and if you’re on the road you get $125/day in LOA tax free. 

Brand new first year apprentices start at $30/hr plus benefits and pension and everything else I mentioned above.

Insurance salesmen are considered some of the least “trustworthy” people on planet earth. It attracts actual psychopaths and scum with no morals, who could care less about ruining somebody’s finances, and will lie through their teeth for commission. 

Don’t believe me? Call a life insurance salesmen, and have a 30 minute consult, then ask them to “send you their recommended offering” at the end to review. Avoid their high pressure sales techniques and refuse to sign a single line of anything... Take whatever BS plan they suggest and then call a licensed financial fiduciary (keyword “fiduciary” - “financial advisors” often are scum desperate for commission themselves).

A fiduciary has a legal obligation to offer advice in your best financial interest. Ask them to explain why the insurance plan is a scam, which it surely will be. 

You can try this at 1000 different life insurance agencies, and let me know if a single one of the 1000 gets the green light from a legitimate, licensed fiduciary.

The life insurance salesmen know the whole life plans they all push are complete scams, and that the poor, gullible people paying their commission could earn more money by investing in an index fund, which is how their companies stay in business and why they earn the commission they do.",10,1705543379.0,kidj799

careerguidance,plumber,comment,18jx1w6,,"Firstly, I always tell people - trades are never a guarantee to good pay. They are boom and bust subject to construction in your area and health of the economy (in recessions people don’t like to renovate). My dad was a plumber and concrete guy, and he did both residential and union construction and it was not always great money and plentiful work.

Now that we have that out of the way…I am an average sized Korean female that wanted to work on cars and trained to be an automotive and diesel mechanic. I didn’t get told before I already finished school that no shop is going to take a girl seriously and no one would give me a chance on an apprenticeship or even an oil and tires gig to prove myself. And…they’re not wrong. I simply can’t lift a transmission or a differential or even wheels from an average full sized pickup truck easily. I ended up being an inventory manager and Toyota Rent A Car manager at a Toyota for ten years instead and working on vintage Japanese cars as a personal hobby with the help of my friends on heavy stuff like putting a differential back up.

You are not at all off base about the heavy lifting aspect. It’s unrealistic for average gals. I have a friend that’s six foot tall and a power lifter and she probably could do trades, but that’s obviously highly exceptional. What we CAN do is things like - equipment or machinery operation/driving, appraisals/inspections, pest control, forklift work (warehouse work), painting and light renovation work. There’s others too, but this is a good start. Alternatively, engineering is better if you have the smarts and determination.

Some other notes - it’s supposedly getting better out there for acceptance of women in trades, so YMMV compared to my experience. Also, I don’t care if people want to downvote me for being sexist or whatever, but you need to be ok with working in male oriented environments. You need to be able to advocate for yourself, integrate yourself, while also not making everyone feel like you’re a narc or a buzzkill. While you shouldn’t ever be subjected to anything directed towards you, you need to be able to not be too sensitive to things men talk about together.

Anyway, you can then work for short periods of time in a trade or two and see for yourself..

It doesn’t work the other way around where an inspector makes special requests to the customers that limit the effectiveness of their inspection. You are thinking about this from the wrong point of view.

Also many people find their inspectors from a referral list by the realtor, you aren’t likely to get any recommendations from realtors if you won’t allow the home owners to be present or expect the realtor to do extra work and be present for the inspection.

I made $36k in 2008 doing this at an elite firm in DC. The gal who was my supervisor was there since 1998 and she told me she made $60k. The Legal Secretary’s made $75k+.

This firm also had a patent litigation division and that was probably much more exciting and interesting but I think they might have worked longer hours. My job was strictly 9-5 with 1 hr lunch. 

To become a paralegal, you actually don’t have to have any specific education beyond a high school diploma. But a college degree helps, as does work experience. Ten years in the same field shows persistence, dedication, follow-through and implies you have the ability to get along with others. I think you could transition fairly easily.

In particular, I know people who do sales in the green energy space, working with developers, manufacturers, banks to help set up financing, doing power purchase agreements, etc. Lots of in person work, and having a background in sales and project management would be a huge help. Honestly, the green energy space is growing a ton, and there is growing development in the US. There is tons of work, and you can do in person, even on site visits to wind and solar farms, to factories, to different offices, and then you have the option of moving back to a desk job if you ever feel like the travel is too much (which as you get older, happens to most people for a lot of reasons).

Second idea is consulting. A lot of big consulting firms are looking people with background in tech to help with different project clients. It's still working on a computer, but you travel constantly, mostly to client offices, but depending on the work, you can end up at factories, oil rigs, literally anywhere.

They need people so there’s a good chance you could get the job, especially given your tech background. I did hydrographic survey which utilized my background in IT, data management/ analysis using basic knowledge of hydrology/oceanography, hardware integration/troubleshooting. It’s not a high barrier to entry, I’d say it requires very little specialized skills; if you can use a computer and have a basic understanding of hardware that’s all you need. I’ve sailed as a permanent tech on one of the Alaska ships. Up to 8-9 months at sea, overtime eligible at 2.5x your salary rate. NOAA is reforming benefits for professional mariners, they just increased shore leave which is a form of time off you accrue while you’re underway at sea. This all means you can bank your overtime and cash it out rather than saving those hours to take leave. In the winter you can take 3 months off with all the leave you earn if you wanted to. It’s a federal job so the benefits are excellent. I live rent free, don’t need to cook, and have no commute to work. I’ve gone to some extremely remote places most people will never visit, I’ve seen the northern lights, and sailed next to hundreds of humpback whales in the middle of a feeding frenzy.

Caveats: You will have to get into the union. This is never easy for an outsider and often requires months of networking. You will start at the bottom and work your way up. Ambitious folks can do this in 6-8 years. It's high pressure, high stress, working for 'creative' people who will always make a lot more than do you, and it will be your job to interface between these pie in the sky types and cold, hard reality. Industry is currently shut down and everyone is somewhat uncertain what the future will look like. Involves a lot of driving as you work your way up the career ladder (less once you become a manager). Hours are insane. It will chain you to a HCOL area for the rest of your career.

Positives: Every. Damn. Day. Is. Different. You get to meet, and often work with, some of the most interesting characters out there. You get to see a lot of cool stuff that most people don't see. If you're star struck you will work with celebs but I guarantee this wears off fast. Jobs actually END. Even the worst job will be over in 9 months, you can go live somewhere else and recharge (a lot of us do this), find a different job, whatever. Benefits package is top tier.

In the Washington DC area, you can easily get hired on at 20/hr, work 6 months until qualifications are met to get NICET 1, then get bumped up to 25/hr, work another year and a half and ask a different company for 30/hr. The inspectors around here barely even inspect anything. Getting $80k is definitely a bit harder, but get your NICET 2 and you'll have a shot. 

You can also take online courses that offer certifications and CPD points, such as FireAlarm.Training and NTCs training courses, which while they don't hold a whole lot of value they'll certainly look better than nothing on a resume for someone just getting a foot in the door.

Also mistakes are frequent across all levels of techs, that's why the inspection process exists.

I don't want to discourage you because it's such a critical role and companies always need QA support but from what I've seen it can be a very thankless job on both the manual and automatic testing side. Companies all want to ship product ideas and don't allocate enough time for testing and bug fixing. I'm not in the video game space but most people are familiar with that being an issue there, so that's one easy example. 

Then the product ships and the top level people act surprised it's not working smoothly. Who gets in trouble first? QA for not catching the bug. It's a tough job that can pay great, especially for people just entering tech, but it's a lot of pressure.

My only advice is to sharpen your critical thinking and technical expertise as much as possible.

Prices can be different based on a lot of factors. We have 10y parts and labour, and the best guarantees, without needing a maintenance package for the labour warranty, just about all the others do, which adds 1300-2200 in total cost over the life of the warranty. So we charge more upfront. We never subcontract, and we do everything top to bottom with the install. New electrical connections, return air drop, better filters, we have a custom ductwork shop so everything is done properly and tailored to your home. The big thing though is our 24/7 service with 0 subcontracting. That’s not cheap, but the install is the most important part of your system. A mediocre brand with a proper install is much better than a top end brand with a poor install. At the end of the day it’s a super competitive market, prices are reflective of the total value it brings. True apples to apples offers are tough to find because everyone positions themselves differently. If they cost more but they’re a large reputable company, you’re paying for peace of mind. You don’t want to go cheap on HVAC, electrical, or plumbing. You will pay the difference in the end going cheap. I have lots of people tell me in my sales calls “so and so got a furnace for 2k less than you” and then when I find out more, it’s because they got a mediocre brand, subcontractors, an ok warranty without guarantees, and they don’t offer 24/7 service. Where I live 24/7 service with the company you install with is super important especially in winter, you want fast service under warranty.

careerguidance,plumber,comment,1765moi,,"I work in digital advertising.  So think Google, Meta, TikTok, etc and the advertising they sell on their platforms.  There are two main seller roles (bigger companies will have more support roles), usually called something like an Account Executive and an Account Manager.  They're considered a team working on the same business, but the AEs are going to be more focused around selling and relationship building.  AMs are responsible for more of the day-to-day management of making sure ad campaigns are going smoothly, and are usually also tasked with up-selling based on current performance.

I'm an AM.  My day-to-day involves managing campaigns, putting together reports and insights, identifying optimizations clients can make on their campaigns to improve performance, and a whole lot of other random tasks that need to be completed around the campaigns on an ongoing basis.  Most of the client interaction is over email, and we have occasional meetings for broader strategy syncs, or honestly a lot of the time just to see people in person.  AM suits me well because I'm introverted and like working with data.  I've been able to automate/streamline a lot of my processes so I can do the job in my sleep.

Yes, there are sales quotas.  I've been at two companies doing this and both were on quarterly quotas.  At both companies, AEs have a split in their comp of 50% base pay + 50% bonus, whereas AMs have a 70% base + 30% bonus structure (and you'll likely also get stocks in the form of RSUs).  When I started 12 years ago, I was making $50K base and it's tripled since then, so there's a lot of upside with the comp.  The bonuses can be pretty nice, usually with an accelerator (e.g., 105% attainment could mean 110%+ bonus payout) and *sometimes* a decelerator at some companies if you miss (e.g., 95% attainment might mean 90%- bonus payout).  You can also miss bonus payments if you don't hit a threshold (e.g., my company withholds bonus if you don't hit at least 50% of quota, which has only happened to me once in 12 years).  I'm not the biggest fan of the ad industry in general and have been itching to get out, but the compensation has been a life changer, and it has been really nice working with competent people you can always rely on.",1,1697201511.0,k4p75zr

careerguidance,plumber,comment,1765moi,,"Let me introduce some counterpoints. 



>Less commuting, less stress, fewer expenses. Should WFH employees be paid less than their office based counterparts is the question I pose.

WFH employees should definitely not be compensated less, just as an employee who lives across the street from the office likely isn't paid less than an employee who lives an hour a way. 

Additionally, the employer is able to push a lot of expenses onto the employees. Office equipment, electrical, internet, lunches/snacks, heating, etc. 

>Improved work life balance and freedom to build your work schedule around personal errands such as picking kids up from school. Can that negatively effect productivity?


It can also improve productivity. For example, my team (high level IT) we find it much easier to spread our schedules out so that we have coverage for office hours and then ""focus/quiet"" hours where we can work on projects. 

It also makes it easier to work with different timezones. 

>There are fewer work related distractions. However home distractions can be just as intrusive; doorbells, kids, pets etc.

This is of course different for everyone, but in my experience there are far less distractions working from home. In fact there are many days where I can basically get ""into the zone"" and practically work the whole day and not even notice. 

>However this is more technology to maintain, buy licenses for, and more to go wrong which can adversely effect productivity.

These might be things you have to deal with already. For example traveling sales folks, or external business calls with clients. Additionally, a ""remote first"" technical infrastructure design can end up saving the organization money and also provide additional security. For example, if you close down your office you no longer need to purchase and maintain WAP (including licensing), access control systems, etc. 

>Geography no longer limits possible new job locations

This also means it's easier to find and retain good talent. It just means the business has to be competitive. Just this year a couple of EXCEPTIONAL team members had to move out of state. If my company wasn't remote-first we would have lost incredibly difficult to replace people. 

>WFH also creates isolation and disconnection from your workplace.

This comes down to company culture in my opinion. It's just as easy to feel disconnected from my workplace even if I'm physically inside the building. 

Doing team events, interest groups, etc is a great way to counteract this. 

>There's a temptation to overwork, which negates the benefits of work life balance and mental health improvement.

I will agree with this one, and I'm definitely guilty of it. However this is a thing leadership can help. For example, being aggressive about offering ""rest days"" and actively encouraging people to sign off. My boss will regularly ping me and tell me to stop working. 

>And lastly, yes, there are those who find staying focused and on task within a WFH role a challenge.

I completely agree. Which is why I think the best way is OPTIONAL hybrid. Have some desks available in office that people can work in if they prefer. 

>There are areas of business that remote or hybrid working are preffered and encouraged such as sales. However, from a business point of view WFH can provide more of a hindrance with alot of traditional office based roles.

As someone who migrated pretty much every business industry you can imagine to be remote during Covid, this ultimately just boils down to resistance to change. Yes, some companies that REQUIRE physical footprint, such as manufacturing, can't be totally remote. But there is no reason an office job can't work remote. It might require some technical creativity, but I guarantee there is a solution that will be no hindrance and may in fact even be a better experience than traditional. 

>Hybrid working with 1 or 2 days a week from home is a happy medium, in my opinion, that produces a good work life balance that employees are happy with, and at the same time retains continuity and communication within and between teams.

I feel like making it optional is the happy medium. If an employees work is being completed in a satisfactory manner, then why does it matter if it happens onsite or offsite?

Source: IT that handled migrations to WFH during covid and has seen company leadership perspectives across the spectrum. In my anecdotal experience, the companies that embraced work from home seems to be performing much better (including my own) than those that did not.",2,1697151338.0,k4mog5k

It’s a program where you earn your high school credits while attending community college and having it paid for. I’ve decided that I’ve chosen three careers that would be best suited for me. My first is an electrician, then plumber and lastly nursing. They all pay very well but I’m not sure what would be best for my future. I live in the pnw (Oregon) so electricians and plumber make a lot of money compared to the rest of the states. The wages for all of them are about the same($50 per hour) but the plumbers have the best package that’s $36 but will be close to $45 in 2025. The electrician is around $36 as well but will only increase to about $40. Lastly im not to sure about nursing. Both trades have a 5 year school period but I do get paid and my wages will increase up to around $35 before I can become a foreman and make $50. Nursing is only 2 years of school and pays $50 or around starting out but would it be sufficient to provide for a family if I plan on getting married around 21 or later. Also I’ve heard about travel nurses who make alot more money up to $4000 a week which is about $100 an hour. I’m also a dude so it kinda makes things a bit different if I would go for nursing.
I’m really open to any ideas because my dad wants me to go as an electrician and he’s an electrician to but he’s fine with me becoming a plumber.

I graduated over a year ago with my Bachelor's in energy/renewable energy management. I had hopes and dreams of managing a wind farm, being a project manager for solar projects, or even working in a hydropower plant. I thought - this is the next big industry. Maybe I was a bit ahead of my time. Definitely naive. I feel like my degree is totally useless. 

I've applied and applied and applied. But every solar job out there is in sales. I've interviewed for solar technician positions, but lack the trades experience. Every wind farm or hydropower plant would never hire me fresh out of college. They require years of certifications just to be a technician. I thought I'd be able to skip over that to be a manager. 

I can work with natural gas, oil, etc, as well, and have taken courses. But any job remotely related to what I'd like to do are going to people with trades experience. My degree is sort of confusing to people. I've learned about all the different kinds of energy, I've learned project management knowledge, I've taken an OSHA 10 course, I've learned about energy efficiency, and taken a few construction courses as well. My degree is like a hybrid of blue and white collar. 

So far, my relevant experience is a year of energy efficiency inspecting. I was conducting blower door tests, duct blaster tests, inspecting for voids in homes thermal boundaries, inspected insulation, duct work, etc, and inputting every aspect of the home in a very thorough program to produce energy efficiency tax rebates from the government, mostly for contractors. (I could've been HERS/RESNET certified, but I relocated before I was presented the opportunity.)

I have 8 months of volunteering in wildlife conservation. 

Currently, I'm in construction, still performing inspections. I inspect concrete, grout, mortar, floor levelness/floor flatness, fireproofing, and wet mil thickness. I have the opportunity here to get into soil and steel inspecting once I advance enough. 

I just feel so stupid only making $19/hour. I went back to school so I wouldn't have to struggle anymore. I do get decent per diem and/or gas mileage. But the benefits aren't the greatest. I want to work somewhere longterm and where I can retire comfortably from. I *have* fallen in love with construction. I've been thinking of pivoting careers and finding a trade I'd like to get into. I think I've reached a dead-end pursuing renewable energy careers.

I also have my PMP, Project Management Professional cert. I thought I’d move up quickly, but, haven’t.

Trying different things. Applied for 18 internal jobs. Got rejection emails on 17.

Looking at other companies too. Being in E Austin, and besides being close to Tesla, there’s not a lot around here, besides government jobs, construction, Applied Materials, as far as I know.

Thinking what might also be going against me

My last few jobs show, prior to here, newest to oldest:  
\* field engineer (going to different places, and installing/working on routers/switches/telephone equipment, etc), picking up gigs on fieldnation.com and workmarket.com.  
\* desktop support - 7 months as a contractor  
\* project manager. I was self-employed for a few years.  
My age. Early 50s.   
I never really had a proper IE role.

For now, I’ve been applying to more jobs, both internal and external, and networking, try to meet people here, going through LinkedIn contacts, checking iise.org, and different events like PMI Austin.  
Keeping at it.

I'm an individual contributor. Our annual reviews have come and gone and for the 2nd year in a row, I got the top score possible. My boss and management recognize my efforts and my results, but because the corporation as a whole dictates our raises and bonuses, and our management is required to stay within the miniscule budget they're allotted for their team's raises, I got the maximum allowed, but it wasn't much overall. However, I do make s good salary (6-figures) and the benefit package is outstanding. I love my management as well. 

Now, I love my job. I really do. And I'm damn good at it. But here's the thing... after receiving max scores on my reviews 2 years in a row, I feel like my potential in this position is capped. How can I possibly grow and develop if my management is not giving me any constructive feedback in my reviews?

I've tried working on getting a promotion in my team structure, got an interview, but when it was all said and done, the position went to another candidate. I asked the panel what I could develop to give me the chance to grow the skills they felt I was lacking. Their response was there was nothing. I knocked it out of the park! So this tells me it was all salary- based, because my COL area is much higher than the person they have the position to because they are in an area with a much lower COL.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I feel stuck. It's a weird place to be in because if I didn't like my job so much, I'd just start looking elsewhere to continue developing. But the grass is definitely green on my side of the fence and I'm grateful.

careerguidance,green construction,post,1bl3qh1,At what point do you decide that you are not a good fit for the role?,"Hi all,

Back in September, I accepted a job with a family member’s fast-growing business in one of the construction trades. My role here is to help manage a large account: sheduling, project management, estimating and material procurement, among other things.

For context, I have a MACC and had worked the last two years in finance/accounting. I had planned on starting to study for the CPA exam in my state and look for roles at accounting firms once I had 2/4 or 3/4 tests passed. Prior to that, I worked retail for a number of years to put myself through college. I have always been a top performer and was considered in the top 5 region-wide in my senior role at my last position. I am 28M.

Back to the current situation; I accepted the job offer because my family member expressed to me that they had no one to pass the business to once they retire and wanted me due to my experience, track record, and education. 

I have only ever worked in corporate settings. This job has a max of 2/3 people in the office (including me) and they have never trained anyone in a position like this, so the guidance is confusing at best. I’ve often found that no one has guidance for certain problems I run into in the scope of my work and there is minimal documentation of anything. The business is almost entirely paper-based as well, which I have been struggling to keep organized and find information. The owner would like to keep it that way until they retire.

I am 8 months in at this point and feel completely green. The pay is good and the hours are not bad, but my self-evaluation is abysmal. I rarely know how to tackle issues that come up, and am constantly making mistakes and incorrect judgement calls. The owners have not expressed dissatisfaction with my work, but I am incredibly dissatisfied with it.

I miss working in the industry that I am educated in. I was such a strong performer and everything “clicked”. Is it too early to call it quits?",2,1711125706.0,

I have been in this role and at this company just over one year. I like the people I work with and overall enjoy the work. But I am still learning a lot about residential construction and feel green. 

Prior to that, I worked at a shmedium steel plant in various roles as a project manager, production manager, buyer, and more for five years. More of a manufacturing, as opposed to construction, kind of industry. It was very stressful, but it's the kind of environment I thrive in. I grew into a level of expertise that made me feel very comfortable in my roles, but I felt as though I was bumping up against the ceiling. I felt like I helped bring the place into the 21st century and many aspects of the business were improved. I was passionate about it. But it became apparent that there was nowhere higher to go, and raises were refused. So, I moved on to my current role. Which has been, paywise, a lateral move into something new, but it has been slow going and frankly unexciting. I have often found myself missing the chaos of manufacturing. 

A recruiter reached out to me two weeks ago about a much larger steel company in the southwest looking for a purchasing role. The phone interviews went swimmingly and they flew me out for 3 nights this past weekend to explore the area and see their operation. Every aspect of the visit blew my socks off. The job is mine if I want it, and it is my personal dream job. It's 2.5x+ my current salary, executive level position, company truck, gas card, a year of housing allowance, bonuses, relocation, etc. Despite the intense imposter syndrome, I made it to the offer stage. This is a huge step up for my career. No brainer despite the cost of living expense difference, right?

So it would be a welcome return to my natural state in the high desert from this stinky swamp (Subjectivity included for perspective of attitude). I took my wife and daughter with me on this visit. My daughter (8) loved it and wants to move, an idea she was adamantly against until we visited. 

Here's the onion. Wife (40) is pregnant with our son due Halloween, so to her, this concept of moving couldn't have come at a worse time. She is nesting and the idea of moving is nearly inconceivable to her. Which is completely understandable, and I completely support her. And the prospective company has shown some willingness to be patient, but have been vague in how long they are willing to wait. She is willing to move but says that the timing, and a career change for her, makes the idea impossible. I am willing to accept a hard no from her, but not until I have done everything I can to try and make this work. At the moment, she is doing her best to be open minded at my request. 

I think the answer is to come up with some kind of compromise/hybrid schedule for a bit while the baby gets settled, but I am open to other ideas. 

Has anyone gone through anything similar? I am keen and grateful to hear any advice/similar experiences/ideas i could propose to both the company and wife. Many thanks ahead of time.  

Tl;dr Life changing job offer, wife has impending infant entrenched in her. I want to support her as best I can, but I think this is an opportunity that might not come around again for some time and is for the greater good of the family. Unsure at this point how long the prospective company will give me to move out. What do?",1,1694457003.0,
careerguidance,green construction,post,16s1ka8,Make the move?,"Reposting this in hopes I get a reply or two. It is a novel, but I wanted to be thorough. I need some objectivity.

I (35M) currently live in the southeast and work for a local home developer as an estimating/purchasing manager. I have been in this role and at this company just over one year. I like the people I work with and overall enjoy the work. But I am still learning a lot about residential construction and feel green, and it doesn’t excite me. 
Prior to that, I worked at a small/medium sized steel plant in various roles as a project manager, production manager, buyer, and more for five years. It is more of a manufacturing environment as opposed to construction. I grew into a level of expertise that made me feel very comfortable in my roles and really loved the work, but I felt as though I was bumping up against the ceiling. I felt like I helped bring the place into the 21st century and many aspects of the business were improved. It eventually became apparent that there was nowhere higher to go, and raise requests were refused. So, I moved on to my current role. Which has been, salary wise, a lateral move, but it has been slow going and frankly unexciting. I have often found myself missing the chaos of manufacturing.
A recruiter reached out to me several weeks ago about a position at one of the largest steel companies in the country located in the southwest/high desert area looking for someone with my experience to fill a Director of Purchasing role. The phone interviews went fantastic, and they flew my family out. Every aspect of the visit blew my socks off. It is my literal dream job. Since, I have been told last Friday that the job is mine if I want it, and to let them know what it will take to get me to move out here. 
I do know that the range is 2.5x+ my current salary ($85k current vs $200k prospective). It is a huge jump professionally as it is an executive level position at a $500mil/yr company. I am told I can negotiate a company truck, gas card, a year of housing allowance, bonuses, relocation package, etc to ease with the transition. 
Subjectively, my daughter and I are all for it. I am originally from the southwest but have lived in the southeast for ten years (military service/ family). So it would be a welcome return to my natural state in the high desert from this swamp that has not grown on me in the slightest over the past decade. I dropped my home life to move out here to my wife who had a career, while I was going to college post-military. 
Here's the onion. Wife (40) is pregnant with our son and is due in less than a month. So to her, this offer couldn't have come at a worse time. She is nesting and the idea of moving is nearly inconceivable to her. This is completely understandable, and I completely support her… but I feel like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Timing is rarely ever perfect in life. My niche skillset has landed me an executive level role at a large company at the age of 35. The prospective company has offered substantial willingness to be patient given my situation (I have been extremely transparent throughout the process). Despite that assurance, wife says she is willing to move eventuality but says that the timing makes the idea impossible. I am willing to accept a hard no from her, but not until I have done everything I can to try and make this work. At the moment, she is doing her best to be open minded at my request. Her biggest cons: the timing, not being able to find work (I found several open positions for her in her field since), and moving away from my parents who offer a lot of support with the kid as we both work full time. It also overwhelms her to see the cost of living differences, even though I have shown that our lifestyle would be maintained or improved, whether she worked or not. The numbers are just scary for her. I also illustrated that she would have all the time she wanted with the new baby and could go back to work if and when she was ready. 
Has anyone gone through anything similar? I am keen and grateful to hear any advice/similar experiences/ideas. Many thanks ahead of time. DMs are open, too.

careerguidance,green construction,post,1bop5pj,How to go about taking over my father's buisiness with my current life situation?,"**My current situation:**

I am 30 M, finishing masters degree in Mech engineering in a year (HVAC field). Currently working for a small HVAC design company. I love that work. I live in a capital of my country 600km away from my hometown and I would really like to stay here.

**The background of my life:**

Out of highschool, I was A complete idiot, wasted my 20s not doing anything with my life, trying to do other degrees and failing, working some dead-end jobs here and there and basically being a good but spoiled kid who didn't work his ass off while having everything on his plate delivered by his parents love and money. Managed to rise above my immaturity and, thanks to immense love from my family, nothing was ruined between us, and basically everything is great.

**About my father:**

He created his buisiness from scratch by no one's help through hard-work, discipline, being smart and persistent and capable above all (bit of luck here and there). It is an irrigation and agriculture field, basically designing the irrigation system (sometimes agriculture) for green areas in cities, parks, villas, hotels and etc. and then his crew of 10-30 people (varied through years, but now we actually have quite a few of machines too) does the ""dirty work"" of digging, setting it up and etc. Currently the company is bringing around 600-700k euros annualy GROSS, quite lower netto, but still quite a lot of money and 4 of us in the family live really well for the our country standards.

**The issue:**

Given my situation, I am trying to make up for everything and it can't happen overnight.

I work 20 hours per week on my job and go to classes which are required to be present in and my plan is to finish this degree the first second I can, no more laying offs.

Spending a little bit of time every day (approx 1 hour through commute and while at home) to learn German as my 3rd language(English being the second, I am from Europe), cause I strongly believe it might prove itself useful down the road.

When I deduct all the hours of the day, I have little time to help my father or be involved in the buisiness.

I also really plan to stay in this city 600km away from home because I love it, but am not sure what to do.

My plan (through talking with my father million of times) is: finish a degree asap. Keep working for this company for a year or two to be allowed to attend an exam to be accepted into our chamber of mechanical engineers and get my own stamp+signature - basically I will be able to put it on my project documentation and be a supervisor engineer on the field (sorry for the bad usage of proper english words here, but anyone who works in construction knows what that is most probably).

Currently, my father suggests that I should focus on absorbing as much knowledge from this job as possible and when the time comes, he would help me bring the company over to where I live, and basically transfer from horticulture and irrigation to HVAC.

Sounds lovely, but I am scared, I have to learn so much about how to actually manage  installing HVAC designs (I would basically have to work for a company that does that I guess) and that is the easy part. What about management, handling of people, communication skills with employees and investitors, handling such big responsibility.

**Final words:**

Father is in very good health, but he is 63, that is quite old, and I am afraid, because I would love to do either my field, his field, or both, I don't care, both are fun and I don't want his life work to go waste, when I could have it ""easy"" if I succeed and work hard and smart.

**Any advice for me?** Suggestions, opinions? If I get a really sound advice here, it could really bring my life tenfolds up in the next 5-10 years. I strongly believe so. I also believe, that even my father is not 100 % sure about what would be the best move, he wants everything best for me, but I guess he just wants me to focus on the studies right now and not bother, because he is happy that I am finally responsible and turning into a proper man (don't joke at my age, I know I was a failure, that is past me). But I want to make up for it, I want to make sure I am doing all I can, but not sure what.",1,1711501805.0,
careerguidance,green construction,post,1551epn,What do I do now?,"I'll give you my professional life story and you tell me what the heck I should do. This may get long and rambly, so thanks in advance for anyone who makes it through and comments.

I'm 26, female, grew up in Vermont now living in Oregon. Considering moving back to be closer to family, but have a partner in Oregon who enjoys living close to his family there.

I graduated from a well-respected, small liberal arts college in PA in 2018 with a B.A. in Biology and English. I did well but never really felt like I knew what I was doing or why.

I've worked on a few small, sustainable farms over the years - one as an internship in college, some through work-trade traveling, and another internship for a season through a nonprofit that I'm now on the Board of Directors of.

After college I took a position doing communications/marketing for a public transit agency. It was pretty boring and I chose to quit after 6 months. Mostly social media stuff and blog posts that nobody read. I think marketing has the potential to be a good career, but I'm kind of wary of the capitalist system that always pushes more, bigger, better and am wary of being part of that machine.

Then a short stint as a barista before doing the sustainable farming internship for a full season. I liked the idea of small-scale farming, but ended up with pretty bad back issues and realizing that there's no money to be had and it's generally a pretty tough life, especially with climate change related risks going up. So now I just enjoy gardening and don't want to own or work on a farm in any physical capacity.

After that, I worked at a small custom van building shop for a year. I liked working with my hands and learning some carpentry, I enjoyed being on a team at the workshop, but the pay was low and I was craving a job that engaged my mind a bit more instead of just my body. Mostly, just wanted more of a trajectory that I didn't see there. Did manage a department of 2-3 and that was my first real ""leadership"" position of any kind.

Next, in 2022, I joined a sustainable landscaping start up where I worked as a Project Manager/City Manager for over a year until the company went under. That was a cool job - I did everything from upfront client sales to guiding clients through the design phase (we had an in-house team that worked remotely) and then hiring and managing the contractors on projects from $20k-$80k. I had a ton of autonomy and independence, which I loved, and I set my own schedule. I was close with my teammates in other cities and the whole company really liked me. I loved being around the plants when I could, but enjoyed that I didn't actually do any of the dirty work. I liked building relationships with contractors and clients and would like to continue in a position that allows me to network and interact in a similar way. I technically quit at that company, but they went under only a month or two later (I saw the writing on the walls).

I thought I wanted to go into residential green building, but after I left the landscaping job I worked for a small GC firm for about 2 months and really didn't like it. All the phone calls, repeated asks for bids/proposals, change orders, just too much back and forth for me. Plus, the people in construction aren't really my people and I don't have an engineering degree or other experience, and it can take a looooong time to get into a role with any responsibility and even when you do, construction has a lot of rules (rightfully so, but still. My brain enjoys a little more creativity and freedom).

So now I am unemployed and taking the summer off. I don't know what kind of jobs I should be looking for! 

I would like something that is mostly remote (because I want to be able to go home to visit family for multiple weeks in the year without needing to take a ton of vacation) and has the potential to make \~$200k someday (I don't want kids and would like a meaningful career that truly engages me and has leadership potential. I do not need to make that much now or in the next 10 years, just someday. 

I am considering something in the non-profit world of farming and food justice, but the money in that field seems pretty limited so I'm hesitant - although with my experience it seems like the best bet in terms of job success.

I may be able to find other project manager/program manager jobs, but without narrowing down a field I'm struggling to find relevant job postings among the million ""project manager"" jobs.

I could do something in communications/marketing again, but... idk

I would like to be a people manager, but how to get there without starting somewhere else first? Where do I start for that?

I could go back towards the Biology side of things and do ecosystems science related to agriculture, would I go back to school for that? I did a special ""semester in environmental science"" in college and didn't love it. Probably don't want to do lab work because of its in-person nature.

I would consider going back to school, maybe for an MBA or maybe something around organizational psychology since I did a lot of thinking at the start up about how I would run a company or what I would improve (they were kind of a mess). This would be along the lines of consulting.

Given my history, experience and preferences, can you provide any insight? Very open to questions and clarifying anything that's not clear. HELP!

careerguidance,wind technician,post,1biqbse,"I feel lost, what should I do?","I feel a little lost

Hi everyone. 

As the title says I feel a little lost with my professional life. I'm a 31M, living in Ontario. In 2013 I went to University were I got a degree with honours, in Poli Sci. After graduation, I managed to get an internship at a credit union. After a year and a half, I managed to get promoted to full time cashier, and a little after that I got promoted to cashier supervisor. While working there, the customer service aspect of the job really took a toll on my metal health. That's when I decided to pursue a dream I had in Univeristy, which was to work as a Wind Turbine Technician, to eventually open my own business in South America. 

So in 2020 I went to college (technical college) where I got a diploma in Electrical Engineering and Energy Systems. I graduated last year. After a lot of attempts, and a couple of interviews, I still haven't managed to land a job in the wind industry. I have been working at a factory in the electrical department, and the salary and atmosphere there isn't good. I wanted a job in the trades so I can work outside with some adventure, now I'm stuck in a factory. 

When I had the dream of being a wind turbine technician, I was single, and was willing to go to the middle of nowhere to work. During my studies I met the girl of my dreams and got married. Now I can't up root her life to come live with me I  the middle of nowhere. 

So what should I do now? I'm feeling lost and I feel like I'm holding my wife back because she had a great paying job and I can't keep up with what she wants to do in life.

I feel like it's too late for me to go back into any other job, except staying in the trades. And starting a new trades job somewhere else usually means I have to start from zero again, especially with my 1.5 years of experience in the trades.

I have started to expand my job search, like government office jobs, or working for institutions like the Canadian Border Services Agency.

I just don't know what to do now. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

careerguidance,wind technician,post,179m2gy,I have my Bachelor's in energy/renewable energy. Where do I go from here? Really struggling...,"Hello all. I graduated over a year ago with my Bachelor's in energy/renewable energy management. I had hopes and dreams of managing a wind farm, being a project manager for solar projects, or even working in a hydropower plant. I thought - this is the next big industry. Maybe I was a bit ahead of my time. Definitely naive. I feel like my degree is totally useless. 

I've applied and applied and applied. But every solar job out there is in sales. I've interviewed for solar technician positions, but lack the trades experience. Every wind farm or hydropower plant would never hire me fresh out of college. They require years of certifications just to be a technician. I thought I'd be able to skip over that to be a manager. 

I can work with natural gas, oil, etc, as well, and have taken courses. But any job remotely related to what I'd like to do are going to people with trades experience. My degree is sort of confusing to people. I've learned about all the different kinds of energy, I've learned project management knowledge, I've taken an OSHA 10 course, I've learned about energy efficiency, and taken a few construction courses as well. My degree is like a hybrid of blue and white collar. 

So far, my relevant experience is a year of energy efficiency inspecting. I was conducting blower door tests, duct blaster tests, inspecting for voids in homes thermal boundaries, inspected insulation, duct work, etc, and inputting every aspect of the home in a very thorough program to produce energy efficiency tax rebates from the government, mostly for contractors. (I could've been HERS/RESNET certified, but I relocated before I was presented the opportunity.)

I have 8 months of volunteering in wildlife conservation. 

Currently, I'm in construction, still performing inspections. I inspect concrete, grout, mortar, floor levelness/floor flatness, fireproofing, and wet mil thickness. I have the opportunity here to get into soil and steel inspecting once I advance enough. 

I just feel so stupid only making $19/hour. I went back to school so I wouldn't have to struggle anymore. I do get decent per diem and/or gas mileage. But the benefits aren't the greatest. I want to work somewhere longterm and where I can retire comfortably from. I *have* fallen in love with construction. I've been thinking of pivoting careers and finding a trade I'd like to get into. I think I've reached a dead-end pursuing renewable energy careers. Which doesn't make sense to me, as I know the Biden administration is promoting green energy jobs and looking for fresh college graduates to unionize, etc. But I don't know *where* these jobs are occurring or how to get into them.

I flaired this with education and qualifications because I'm not sure if my current experience is enough to pursue a career I really want. 

For a few years, I putted around doing whatever job would pay me well enough. I didn't have any strong desire to do something specific. Eventually, I ended up at Firestone (big chain automotive repair facility for those unfamiliar) as essentially a service writer. A few weeks into being there, they started a hybrid position that handled creating service tickets/selling AND did light work on vehicles. I took advantage of this and managed to reliably do what was labeled as ""C-tech"" level work; oil changes, brakes, various suspension, alignments, things of that nature. I stayed there for a little over 2 years. 

After leaving, I found myself in a diesel technician position for TA, where i actually worked on just about anything that wasn't internal engine/transmission. I was tracing electrical issues, replacing waterpumps/alternators/starters, tires, all fluid changes, running diags, etc.

 After having my son and no longer being able to work night shifts, I left and now work as a test technician for a company that develops parts for vehicles, mainly EVs. 

Since starting this job last year, I've found that I absolutely despise desk work. I miss working on things myself, and searching for the problem and solving it. I miss feeling useful. My dads been a lifelong mechanic, and I think I want to be one too.

All of this long-winded explanation was just to show where my experience lies. I have no formal training or certificates, but I want to apply for technician spots. There's tons of openings around where I live, but I'm always worried I'll embarrass myself applying for them. Do you guys think I'd have a shot anywhere like this, and for any old time Greasemonkey, would you be ok with someone like me coming to work with you? I learn relatively quickly, and love the work, so I don't think I'd be a waste. I'd obviously need help and have to learn as I go however, so I don't want to be a burden on a shop.

In regards to not getting official training or anything, my fiance has a 6 year old and we our son just turned 10 months old, as well as she works midnights while I work days. It's extremely hard just to do simple things, let alone think of attending any sort of schooling that's not online. I'm only 29, so plenty of time in the future but I'm burning out at this job lmao.

careerguidance,solar installer,post,19fbwil,Stay and learn HVAC or go to solar sales?,"I have an opportunity to work in solar sales in Northern CO. I'm currently an HVAC apprentice and less than one month away from getting my EPA cert and subsequently getting into my own truck. 

I don't like working in HVAC. Waking up early, 50+ hours a week, back hurts, never enough time to unwind and sleep. But I like my coworkers and I'd feel bad leaving right before I start making the company money. On top of that, being an HVAC tech for this company offers some sales-y opportunity; we get SPF's for anything we sell. For example, $75 for selling a duct cleaning, I think $25 for selling a humidifier. Plus 4% of any revenue if you turn a project over to the sales team; for example, if you condemn a furnace with a shot heat exchanger and the client replaces the system for $14,000, I would get $560 from it. Not bad money on top of the $20 hourly, and the top performers in my field make around $100k-$120k/year. On top of that, I'm learning a trade that guarantees job security for the foreseeable future. 

The sales job is tempting though, as sales is where people make money. It's door-to-door, entry-level, training, benefits, all that. The recruiter I talked to said sales guys average 10 appointments a week, $100 for every appointment that gets a consultant out to estimate the logistics of the solar install, and $800 for every appointment that leads to an install. Recruiter claimed about a 30% turnover rate from appointment to install, and about $2200-$3000/week for thw sales guys. I'd get to work in my town, no more than 20 minutes from home. 40 hours a week, not 50+. 

I still have some more details to work out about the solar sales job such as taxes, company policies, whether I'm going to be screwing people into bad deals like a lot of solar companies do. But given the opportunity, and considering the easier time it would give me for my time and health, should I drop a skilled trade for sales? 

My only real worries are that the economy may not support sales jobs the way it has for much longer. I fear a recession and don't know what implications the already slowing economy would have for solar sales.

careerguidance,solar installer,comment,16mxzql,,"I work in finish carpentry and run a CNC for a custom exhibit company. Not to get all gender-ish but here I personally find the women are often naturals for finish work. Our hands are not as callused as most men and many women enjoy a nice aesthetic for interiors so we’re often more picky when it comes to the finished look of items vs tiring out from physical labor. For example, the women I work with don’t say ‘meh, it looks good enough’ or ‘no one will notice this’, whereas I find many of the guys we work with are generally less obsessed with quality. Women have also tended to be better in our quantity inspections too. 

If you’re particular and don’t mind light physical labor (similar to doing basic interior home renovations) you’d be great. Here, most of our customers are museums or trade show exhibitors, so art, graphics, and an aesthetic are important. Similar places would be custom cabinet builders, or local remodeling companies.

If you’re in a larger city local theaters can use volunteers or prop makers - a great way to learn some basic tool use for free, score free show tickets for your time, and get a taste of very basic building. Not finish quality and not similar building practices or master carpenters or safety requirements, but a good non-committal way to see if you like that kind of work, and your help will be welcomed. 

Commercial and residential cabinet makers are often very busy in larger cities. Once you learn enough you could opt for starting your own cabinet business. You’d want about 4 years mastering tools and skills, measuring and installing. A basic love of what power tools can do is important. A CNC would be very helpful. Learning how to operate a small mom & pop variety of CNC is helpful and fairly easy (I learned from LOTS of YouTube and phone-in support from our vendor). 

Finally, another cool job or career path would be prop making if you’re in LA, Miami, or New York. For that you need great carpentry skills, quality work and speed for fast turn around, a CNC, good sculpting and sanding skills, painting and some airbrushing skills.

My dad worked in CNC machining and somehow I've inadvertently started taking on machining work too. 

I teach AutoCAD, and my school has been building an impressive CNC lab over the past few years. My supervisors are very interested in getting me trained on the machines, so that is very exciting.

The impression I've been getting is that it's worth it to pick up some design and programming skills along with CNC operation! They're apparently a very valuable set of skills. 

While not usually relevant, I could mention that I'm also a 24 year old woman. In my experience working with machinists in the lab, it's the AutoCAD skills I bring to the table that stand at the forefront, because it's something most of the machinists aren't deeply versed in.

When my dad worked in machining, he didn't actually make that much money, but he was taking on relatively unskilled positions that were primarily in CNC operation. While that wasn't ideal for him, I think it's a good sign that the bar for entry into the industry isn't as high as some other skilled trades.

Are there any kind of special certifications or technical skills that can be learned and applied somewhere without having to go back to school?,"I’m currently 5 years out of college (Graduated from TCNJ in 2019) with a degree in history and minor in public policy management/analysis, and have been working in solar installation since August ‘19. The money has been good for the most part but I have little to no interest in the fluctuating pay-scale or being a laborer, plus not using the skills or abilities I have/cultivated in school. 


I graduated from school with some great experience in the public education historical field (wrote blogs at local state parks, then spent a semester researching social diversity at my school where I helped construct/organize an on-campus related exhibit and wrote a paper on the subject which was published by the schools student journal, then spent last year in college working at the NYC Holocaust museum giving in-school lectures, 1.5 hour long tours of museum, and analyzing survivor testimony to annotate accounts and create corresponding video clips for exhibit installations). While these all were valuable and enjoyable, I didnt acquire much technical knowledge or experience.  The idea of working actively in an archeological setting or doing geographical work based on historical context is the dream and always has been, but I appreciate also that these jobs are competitive when it comes to demand and salary. I also know that a degree or certification in GIS can be more demanded and lucrative in the civil/environmental development industries so I guess that would be an alternative route that could work out too. 

So basically, I’m wondering is GIS worth pursuing as a healthy mix between my interests and possible well-paying job opportunities.  I’m not totally opposed to returning to school part-time. My wife is a registered dietician and does rather well and we have a daughter to take care of now, so I’m wondering if school or online certifications is the best option.  I’ve considered pursuing online certificates in marketing, business, or banking/finance as well but those don’t suit my skills/interest/experience as well as something like archeology or geographic pursuits might as much as an education or certificates in GIS might.

What I’m finding is that once you’re in your program you just need to find your niche and get some sort of working experience via an internship. After that, doors open a lot more easily. Hope this helps! Feel free to shoot me a dm if you have any questions.

Edit: just read that you already have a degree. There are a lot of schools that offer GIS/geospatial analysis graduate certificates, a lot of them online, which would probably be more up your alley so you don’t have to go back for another full bachelors.

careerguidance,solar installer,post,17wbskc,Advice on what I should do? Sales are in the dumper. Considering a pivot.,"Hello,

First time posting here but this community seems pretty helpful. 

31 yo male. Engaged w/ no kids. Currently in solar/home improvement sales in CA. Have been working in solar for about 6 years. Started with installations and moved over to sales for the last 4 years. The sales were just enough for part time work for the first couple of years but became busy enough to support me full time the past couple of years.

This position has been 1099 and largely commission only. I love the flexibility of making my own schedule and largely working remote with some on site visits occasionally. I consider my self an expert when it comes to residential solar and storage projects. I am competent from design and engineering to sales and project management working with multiple parties to ensure a successful and well coordinated project. 

I have increased my income year over year, currently at about 70k before expenses and taxes. Beginning of this year was my largest volume of sales so far. Sold and managed about a million dollar pipeline. 

Since then, sales have come to a screeching halt. If you know anything about solar in CA, changes to policy with the utilities known as Net Energy Metering (NEM) have set the industry way back since the new program essentially doubles the ROI for people to go solar and requiring project costs to be more expensive by needing to add batteries these days (happy to discuss this more in detail but want to keep the post focused). The whole NEM situation is compounded by interest rates being as high as they are which make the payments for the loan unreasonable compared to paying the utility unless people can put significant cash down payment. Leases/PPAs are becoming more popular in this environment but still have an overwhelming amount of people that are against them as opposed to ownership of the system. 

I feel like the walls are closing as I have gone from a 40% close ratio to as low as 10% recently. With my pipeline of installs drying up, it will be financially unsustainable in a short amount of time. 

Im educated, very personable, hardworking and can see myself being virtually good at anything I apply myself to. Should I stick out the current situation or commit to jumping ship sooner than later for new opportunities? If so, what roles should I start looking into?

I have a bachelor's in business with a focus in marketing and still in debt for college loans so hopefully not trying to add to them.

Currently working as a phone salesman in a call center and just not enjoying any minute of it. The quotas and the pressure just gets to me plus the cut-throat lifestyle of sell or leave just kills me. Makes me feel like I'm worthless sometimes and just want to quit.

Worked some office jobs in the past and never seem to make it a very long time in the position no matter the money. I just get drained and feel like it's all pointless. Not wanting to go to bed because of work just plain stinks.

Ive worked outside in the past as a Crew Lead for a solar installing crew and enjoyed it a lot but got hurt and had to leave as I was not making any money while injured and put me in a bad position. Pretty much how I ended up where I am now for work.

Trying to research into positions that would be fulfilling and not make me feel like crap at the end of day. I love spending time in the outdoors and with animals and feeling like I'm helping or teaching throughout my life.

Been researching into maybe trying to become a firefighter but also wanting to see other options.

careerguidance,solar installer,post,18d7bjr,What can I do next?,"Good evening for everyone. 

Firstly: sorry for my English, I’m Ukrainian, whom living in Poland for 8 years, so my knowledge of this language so-so. 

I wanna to tell you my studying and career story. 

I am a Ukrainian immigrant in Poland. I'm 22 now, I moved to Poland when I was 15 and for almost 8 years now I've been trying to build my life here.
I graduated from college as a technician of alternative energy systems.

I entered one of the best universities in Poland to study management, but I never finished it. It was a rather impulsive decision. 

Due to the war, I was unable to finish my studies, as neither I and my parents don’t had enough money for pay for uni due to the political situation.  

Nevertheless, I worked as a waiter and as a solar power plant installer.
On the more serious side, I worked as an office manager for a year, and on the most interesting side, I was a personal assistant to the CEO.

But.
It was a Ukrainian office in Poland that had emigrated due to the war, and with a very dishonest CEO. Obviously, I realise that at 21, it was the perfect job for me, given the contacts and experience I could gain, but all I got for my honest and hard work was 
a broken car (because I performed all tasks by my car), 

And

a low salary. 

After a year and a half, I was burnt out, I lost my nerve and quit.

Now I'm unemployed and thinking about what to do next.

I have an incomplete higher education with an incomprehensible, in my opinion, speciality.
I understand that I have disappointed my parents. And I don't understand who I am and in which direction I should move on.

I’m think about moving to USA, I don’t afraid about hardworking, but it’s another story. 

Thank you all for your advices forward.",2,1701987630.0,

So, as the title says, my boyfriend (26M) is struggling in his career path. Right now, he works as a cashier in a local bakery. It’s good (not great) pay and he likes the social aspect of getting to interact with customers, but he definitely hopes not to be in the service industry long term.

He is planning to make a shift into another field that pays well and is more sustainable for the long term. He has interviewed for a few sales positions- windows (he actually worked for a window replacement company for a few weeks but felt very scammy), solar, paper. This is a possible avenue for him- he's very charismatic so he would make a good salesperson.

I personally think a trade would be great for him (carpentry, plumbing, air conditioner installing/repair), as these skills will always be in demand, but I think he feels intimidated by learning a completely new skillset that would take a few years before it began to pay off, in addition to $$$ spent for certifications/trainings.

We (27F&26M) are starting to look toward the future together (marriage, kids, house, alladat) and he is starting to think about how he can provide for us and our future family.

He is super brilliant and has a lot to offer but has unfortunately come upon some financial and family hardships that have held him back. This has definitely hurt his confidence and I just want him to feel secure & confident in his path.

Does anyone have any experience with starting from scratch in a career field? How did you go about this switch? Did you need to go back to school? How did you support yourself during this switch? How is your career going now? What guidance would you give to someone ""starting over""?

TL:DR, 26M boyfriend looking to make a career change. Does not want to be in service industry, but does not have lots of experience in other fields.

career_advice,technician,post,1dhowik,My employer is back charging my paycheck because of a new policy.,"A new policy was ""created"" at the beginning of this moth (June) that states if a pest control technician is not on a property preforming a service for at least 20 min and the customer decides not to pay the bill for any reason, the technician will be back charged the full price of the service, (not the commission we make off of the service).

The reason I say ""created"" is because there was no official meeting held about this change of policy, nothing was signed by us stating we agreed to this change. I wasn't told this change of policy from management. I was told by a co worker.

So on top of not being told officially that this major change is taking place. I am being back charged for a service that I had preformed back in February. Way before this policy was created at the beginning of June.

The customer was able to be contacted via a brother who only speaks Spanish and told our company that the customer in question is in the hospital. So i would assume this is the main reason why they cannot pay the pest control bill. It has nothing to do with the quality of the service i provided or me being on the property for at least 20 min.

This is the first case of this happening at my company and i believe this will happen to every other pest technician that works with me. We all deal with high balance accounts each month, at least 1-5 accounts a month will not pay the bill and most of the time it doesn't have something to do with the quality of the service. We get high balances for a variety of reasons. Financial, moving house, death of the homeowner.

In this case it seems like the homeowner was hospitalized and that is the main reason the bill is not being paid. Everyone whom I've asked about this says this sounds illegal. What do you guys think?

For right now I am being back charged $50 for a pest service my company is charging the customer $120. I myself only make 19% off of that service. They state next time this happens it will be for the full price of the service in question.",2,1718595647.0,

Been thinking about getting into the IT industry so I could have a more tech focus job which would be less physical as I age. 

I never finished college, but while I was in school I did the internet technologies track at my local community college which consisted of web development classes which were php, C#, html, css, and even had a summer class that had 6 of us which we build a tourist like website which I passed the instructors checklist and passed the class. That class was the last of the tech classes I just didn't have the general ed stuff done. As far as gen ed classes I did get an A in college algebra and didn't find the final exam that challenging, I just had a really good teacher :)

Also took classes like introduction to networking and database fundamentals. Out of all my tech classes I seem to have enjoyed database fundamentals the most and wondering if maybe I could look into that?

I have not messed with any of the stuff I learned in school which was around 6 years ago when I went, but really don't want to be stuck stocking groceries the rest of my life.

Hey y’all. I’m absolutely so lost with what I want to do as a career and was hoping to get some ideas. I’ve looked into being a nurse, but it seems really hard, and math and science have never been my strong suit, but I love chaotic jobs that force me to move around a lot and be social. I was a good student in high school overall, but never saw myself working in healthcare, until I got into my current job which is a pharmacy technician. I find it very boring, just filling prescriptions all day and doing boring computer stuff without moving around too much, but the education I’ve had to do leading up to it is pretty interesting. I used to be a department manager at Walmart and I LOVED it aside from a few shitty bosses I had, and eventually I saw myself becoming a store manager, but the more I talked to people the less I think it is a realistic choice even though I would love it. The competition is unimaginable and it sucks getting up to that point (terrible schedule, long hours, average pay). I’m going to college because I felt like I had to but really I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Plz help!

career_advice,blue collar,post,16az1ws,I'm 21 and looking for advice in getting a Tech Job.,"So, lets get some background before I just randomly ask for advice.

I'm 21, interested in computers, took some college classes in High School and would like to finish my degree and get a job in the field. I've built and repaired well over 500 computers (thanks classes in HS) ranging from personal computers, gaming rigs, and workstations.

I also had a major bump in the road getting a couple hefty jail sentences because of my dumbassery as a teenager.

In the past I had a cisco certification, an A+ certification and a CompTIA certification. Though all of those have lapsed since High School.

I currently work as a manager in the food service field and have been doing this job for a while now.

My biggest problem is two things, I got a theft charge, and a drug possession charge as a result of my stupid teenager brain, and I really quit out on being focused, going to school, and getting my stuff handled for a professional career.

I've also never held a job for longer than 10 months prior to my current one, and I'm sure that looks horrible on a resume. I know that nowhere wants to hire an IT guy that will be there for less than a year regardless of their qualifications and knowledge in the field.

My long term goals are to run my own computer repair shop (preferably not mobile phones or mobile devices in general) or run a cyber security consultation firm after working for around 5-10 years in the field.

I'm almost certain due to my theft charge I won't be able to get any job in security systems and will probably for the next long while be stuck doing basic helpdesk related work, which is fine by me for the time being but I would want a job with the opportunity for upward progression within any company I work for, but with my criminal record I worry I'll be cut short in that regard.

My intentions as of now are to pursue finishing my degree, but due to my location (smaller very blue collar town, though I'm originally from one of the major US cities) I worry there won't be job opportunities that utilize my degree at all, which kind of turns me off to the idea of going to school, as I don't want to move away from where I am. I've built a new life for myself here and I'm getting comfortable in the current situation. I also met a girl and I really think she's the one, and she's completely opposed to the idea of moving away from where we are.

Best advice for me moving forward with my life and getting an IT job?

TL;DR: I need advice on getting a job in tech while living in a community that is small enough that there's not really options for a tech job.",3,1693945520.0,
career_advice,blue collar,post,1b7c12i,Could I ask for some advice?,"I've looked everything up. I've seen just about every google idea, heard every quote and concept, you name it - I still have no idea what I want to do for work. I can't skate by without a skill. Retail is inconsistent and doesn't pay, warehouse jobs, etc. - they're just not sustainable choices.

I love anatomy. Maybe it's from the trauma, maybe it's not, but I just do - I love bodies. I love biomechanics, working out, figure drawing, dissections. I love spending time with other physical manifestations of life too - I love trees and animals and how different and functional and beautiful they all are across the board. I spend time drawing animals and finding muscles and bony landmarks on myself. I spend time on trails and training my dog and taking care of house plants.

I love physically existing in places. I love designed environments - the functionality and personalization. I love organizing and decorating, I love modeling environments on the computer, seeing miniatures, I love experiencing mountains and beaches and woods. I love improving, creating, and customizing the places I exist in. I love exploring and seeing new places, seeing how other people personalize their own spaces. I love designed landscapes and architecture.

I'm hitting a road block. I don't know if I love blue collar work, and I don't know that I love academia. I had trouble focusing in school. Working in industrial settings where I'm the only woman isn't my favorite either, even though I genuinely enjoy the physical labor. An open studio - an art studio, a martial arts studio, those are wonderful workplaces that feel somewhere in between. Gardens are wonderful too. I love the quiet, constructive academia of art. I have a very visual, visceral memory. I can recall most environments I've been in and paintings I've seen, even if I've only seen them once. I can close my eyes and 'walk' through my grandparent's old house that they used to live in over a decade ago, sometimes I 'count' my workout reps with yellow blocks in my mind's eye, things like that. I don't focus well on textbooks and I don't always do well with auditory commands either. I have a lot of trouble with focus. I can't always pay attention to conversations or paragraphs. A drawing, though, it's all right there - you study the image, but it's relatively immediate. Drawing comes naturally to me.

But, to be fair, art is a tough career. And that phrase gets tossed around a lot, but it's true - there's no track to follow, no licenses, no certifications or tests. There isn't even a proper way to market yourself, especially considering the fickle, changing environments of social media. It's oversaturated, and with the advent of AI, I'm not trying to pay rent and bills with drawings. I have animals to take care of. Just like retail and warehouse jobs, it's just not sustainable or consistent.

I believe humans are flexible. We're something of a clean slate with a few proclivities, but at the end of the day, we can learn most basic things. I've heard the phrase 'if you can read, you can cook' and I think that applies to many skills.

And then we get into the stray crumbs of thought - regardless of the subject, I know I like working on projects. I prefer working alone, but I get lonely if I do it for too long. If I could work quietly and then present my work to a team of people, that could be healthy. I don't like to sit for long periods of time. I like to be physically active and work with my hands. I don't like working closely with the same people for too long, but I really enjoy working with the public - I like helping people and then sending them on their way. I like making things and visually seeing what I've done, the difference I've made. I liked working outdoors on different properties. Working in the same windowless building every day felt suffocating. Some career ideas got scratched because they're part time work and/or they don't offer benefits. I quit one job I had because the hours were constantly shifting, and without a lot of time off, I couldn't manage my life and appointments outside of work. I would be very bad at a job if I had to market myself or a product. In an immediate sense, some skills - like carpentry or personal training or massage - are appealing to me because I could use it at home to help friends and family. I find it much easier to learn anatomy - a directly relatable, contained thing - than to learn the extensive and messy myriad of plants that exist out in the world.

Different careers I've thought about trying: massage, acupuncture, landscape design, arboriculture, park ranger, postal/delivery, carpentry, furniture flipping, physical therapy, x-ray tech, personal trainer, dog trainer, dog groomer, vet tech, CAD, environment design for video games, art.

I think it's less about the career ideas themselves and more about what's keeping me from choosing one. Every time I have an idea, it sticks for a few weeks or a few months before I feel something different would be a better fit. It feels like the pros and cons are always shifting - a job just decides so much (so much!) about your life. Do you travel? How much do you have to like people? Is the environment engaging? Does it offer reasonable, consistent pay and benefits? Would I have to get clients myself? How serious are the consequences of your choices? Are the hours consistent enough to keep appointments and a sleep schedule? Is the work interesting? Do I have the ability to learn it? Are there places where I could learn it near me and are the classes in-person? Can I afford the schooling? Can I do it for 40 hours a week? Could I do anything for 40 hours a week and hold onto my sanity? If I'm having a bad mental health day, or I can't focus, is it a job I could still reasonably do? Am I helping others? Is it meaningful? Do the people in that field seem like my kind of people, are they satisfied? Can the job be outsourced, done by AI in the near future, or affected by a pandemic? If I move states, could I still find work? Do I want to be able to work remotely? Could I still do this job as I get older? Some days different questions seem more important than others. I had a moment where I realized I really enjoy heights and climbing, so for a week or two I was completely smitten by the fleeting fantasy of being a tower climber or a high rise window washer. I can't picture in my head what most careers will actually look like day to day, the many many contributing factors and even the differences between individual employers and workplaces - I worry about pigeon-holeing myself with schooling and loans and debt. I think therapy could help me very much, but I'd need a job with health insurance first.

I realize I'm overthinking, but 'just pick one' doesn't seem right either.

career_advice,trade school,comment,1b6lfji,,"Stay at your job and look into trade schools near you. My brother got a cert for welding from trade school: the upside is how quickly you can obtain cert and how much cheaper it is compared to a bachelor’s degree. The downside (that others have mentioned below) is health concerns. At my brother’s first job, they didn’t even supply him a mask: he had to buy and bring his own. His health has gotten worse, notably his breathing. If you stick with welding, make sure whomever you work for follows guidelines and doesn’t shortcut. Make sure it’s a spot that doesn’t hire welders uncertified (like my brother’s first job did). Always wear your mask! And if you smoke/are overweight, expect even more health issues to come along the way, as well as shortness of breath.

I don’t mean this to deter you from pursuing welding at all; just be aware of the risks. If you feel comfortable with them, definitely go ahead! And you can always look at other opportunities that trade schools offer (plumbing, carpentry, even IT certs). I’m currently trying to transition out of the elementary ed sphere, so I get how difficult it can be jumping from one industry to the next.

Do you think the millionaires were happy building a business working all day everyday. I’m a roofer and work 12/14 hours a day everyday, I have no life because of work. It’s good because it makes me better at my craft but at the same time wasting my life. With welding it’s a skill, it takes years off practice to make $100 an hour. You can make good money but don’t be disappointed when you’re earning the same as a 16 year old for a few years. People want experience not knowledge when working in a trade. Also it depends on what type of welding you go into, welding steel is pretty simple but aluminium welding or even titanium welding is pure skill. But you can make big bucks especially for custom work as it’s a constant need especially in motorcycles or cars. 

You also need to think about can you do it for the next 30 years and most of the time the answer is no.

I've been thinking about going into the trades for years but I just took in my son full time and I need to start making way more money. I'm trying to find out which industry would be best for me, before I thought about going to school to be an auto tech but I don't think it's going to be high earning enough for me anymore. I really like working with my hands especially on anything mechanical, I'm curious about being an aviation mechanic because the median pay is pretty good, I'm pretty sure I would enjoy it and my only apprehension about it is the hours because I would really like to have a consistent Monday to Friday possibly with overtime. Does anyone know anything about being an aviation mechanic or what trade I could get ready for in 2 years or less that would pay at least 60 Grand a year within a year of graduating trade school.",1,1701557098.0,
career_advice,trade school,comment,189f63i,,"You are looking for a trade that is going to pay roughly around $29 an hour if you’re looking at the 60k mark after one year at a 40 hour work week. If you were going to include overtime maybe shoot for some thing around $24-$25 an hour.

My best piece of advice is if you are looking into getting into a trade of any kind most the time if you go to school and then go into a trade, it is not going to guarantee you to get to a higher salary range. Personally, I, started in the welding trade. My instructor told me that no matter how many certifications I had the employers are not going to care what you did before but what you can do now and that the certifications that you get only get you access to a weld test and an interview. After I completed my one year of welding school, I went and found work, sure enough it went almost exactly how my instructor said. I was given a weld test, passed it, and then started about five dollars above minimum wage, which would’ve been about 16 bucks an hour at the time. I eventually left the welding trade after experiencing and getting to see other trades at work and ended up changing career paths.

If you’re going to go into a trade, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that and honestly I would encourage it as it will in the long run help you with expenses in life that the average person doesn’t realize is literally as simple as screwing in a few screws. I personally don’t know anything about aviation mechanics, but being a maintenance technician is definitely something that could get you into that hourly range of 25 bucks an hour+ in two years without ever having to go to school.  

If you work or have ever worked on cars and have a mechanical mind often times there will be plenty of these jobs and factories always need these jobs filled and can learn off of other technicians. There are a lot of positions that will say they want two years plus of experience And things like that but honestly if you just apply often times they will be pretty open-minded and can score an interview, 

They will often ask mechanical or electrical base questions such as what is voltage and amperage, what is a bearing, if I want a motor to run reverse how would I go about doing that, etc. It often helps if you have any amount of other skills such as welding, soldering, electrical, hydraulics, or pneumatics as maintenance technicians are often considered a jack of all trades job, so having an entry-level understanding in most of these skills is seen as a plus even if it’s as simple as one of the simplest welding processes, MIG welding, or simply knowing how to wire outlets/light sockets.

Another great benefit to maintenance technicians is there’s also wide variety of them. They can range from more entry Levels of technicians that typically only deal on the mechanical side of conveyors all the way up to dealing with robotics and fine-tuning or reprogramming them. I was maintenance technician for about a year and a half and eventually was ending up making about $28 an hour including my shift premium of a dollar. I eventually moved up from a maintenance technician to a commissioning technician for the company I was working at and now go from site to site Installing and helping Debug New machines.

I wish you the best of luck and hope you find what you’re looking for.",1,1701665029.0,kbwz934
career_advice,trade school,comment,189f63i,,"I don’t know the specific requirements for the job you’re looking to get into I can only go off the experience that I have by going down my own path in life. I went to a trade school and the program was about a nine month deal, and I was able to get certifications for welding.

In this case, the school was definitely worth it for me because it was able to get my foot in the door and also allowed me to get up some basic skills and experience because I didn’t have access to a welder or materials to practice on, let alone afford one at the time. It also taught me how to read blueprints and rigging experience as well. All of which was useful and helped me get into my profession that I’m in today.

There are many trades, no matter your schooling, you typically are going to have to prove your ability to get to pay that you want and I find personally that going out into the world and getting the experience is more valuable as on the job training you run into many more real life situations instead of in a classroom setting, where it’s built to be easy most of the time.

While in school, we had a lot of room to manipulate the stinger and could use the entirety of her body freely to maneuver, manipulate our way around while welding, whereas when I got into the field, I had to learn how to do things and tight or confine spaces where many times I only had room with my arm and stinger. No amount of schooling was going to prepare me for Welds like that and often times you don’t see them in a school setting.

One other thing that I would like to mention to is that a lot of work places will pay for your schooling or portions of your schooling. So if you were able to get into the career field, then that may also be an option to save you money on schooling as well as get real life experience at the same time.

As far as what you should do going forward that Has to be a decision that you make. If you Are looking into being an aviation mechanic, do some research on that career field and find what rough salary ranges and outlook are, then start looking at schools, and what curriculum they’re actually teaching you. often times you can see outlines of course and classes and what they’ll go over to make sure you are getting your moneys worth out of it. 

All in all sometimes school can be worth it depending on the career field you’re going to go into. if you’re wanting to do aviation, I would probably say it wouldn’t hurt to do some form of schooling for it. You may also be ahead of some other people if you have mechanical experience. If you are wanting to go towards a maintenance technician, then just having the mechanical experience that you have will probably be enough to get you there without schooling. 

I don’t really know much about aviation, and that field in general so I can’t tell you exactly what is the best route to take for that particular path. But hopefully this gave you some insights to help make that decision for yourself after you put some research into it.",1,1701689857.0,kbxx255

So I am 21 years old , turning 22 in July. I’m about to start working part time before I goto school still need to find myself a vehicle , the area I’m in sucks with finding jobs but I have an interview.(This is all temporary stuff ) I’m about to goto trade school for auto motive technician , it’s a 10 month program and I look forward to it. I know after I get certified for ASE , I can look for an entry level job being I will only be certified and need to get that experience, luckily for me though the local dealerships around me offer apprenticeships for the school I’m attending, I was between becoming a mechanic, construction worker (which I didn’t wanna break my back by the time I’m 35) and lastly an electrician , which I didn’t really feel like was something I wanted to pursue. I just honestly feel like even though I feel like I know what I want to do , I really don’t know. So if there are any workers from the three fields I’ve mentioned above, is your career worth it? I’m not looking for an insane income , I want a good balanced job that I enjoy. I will mention I do have a semi passion for cars just started getting into them as they are fascinating machines.

With that being said whomever is reading this you have a good day and best of luck to where you are in life and may god bless you😊

Edit: I forgot to mention the program for the school is an advanced learning program and is only 10 months. I can also further my education with ford FACT , Honda PACT or whichever dealership with other programs they offer. I always loved Hondas as the accord is my favorite model , but I feel like I would enjoy working at ford. I’m sure both offer ideal benefits and discounts on vehicles if they even do that.

  Being a hostess is not very glamorous. Think about what you are learning. You are learning how to deal with all types of people. You are learning how to better communicate. You are learning patience and how to stand up for yourself in any situation without exacerbating it.
  Sometimes what we see as failing is when we actually learn the most.
  Don't worry about what you think you are missing. What you are getting puts you way ahead of most others. You are on the right path.
  Use your free time now to learn how to get you side business started. Spend a couple of years and grow your side business to where you're financially free. Then when you go to have fun you can do it in total relaxation. You will still be very young.

I was a musician with goals of working full time as a Christian music minister and pastor.   While pursing these goals, I worked in real estate/ property management until I eventually worked full time in ministry.   Long story short, some experience out of my control put an end to that career and I got a job in corporate finance.   I hate office work, client management and traditional business culture.  I have always wanted to stop and work in wildlife management and after trying to do some other paths that weren’t my passion, I am confident that Wildlife management is the field that I want to be in until I retire.   I went to a trade high school and was on the wildlife management track.  I loved it and was a wildlife biology and conservation history were my most impactful classes in school.   

I make ok money and have good benefits as a bonuses in my finance job and was working two jobs since my wife was a stay at home mom with our girls.   I just finished my Associates in Science and am starting an undergrad, where I can start Grad school online my senior year.   I have very good grades now (straight As) but was a weak student when I tried college at 19.  I  didn’t take it seriously.    I came in as a business major and STRUGGLED.   I’m not cut out for it and my temperament doesn’t align with a traditional business path.    

I am looking for a job that could set me up for a career in conservation and wildlife biology, where I can get experience while I am finishing school.   I don’t want to work a job that I hate and then start working in my mid- early 30s.   I
Want to optimize my time but also need to make at least $60,000 to support my family.    My wife is working now, so I have considered serving or something where I could make money and doing school and have a flexible schedule.   I was doing most of my school online at night.   Which isn’t fun but is what it is.  I applied for local state wildlife technician jobs but didn’t get them.  They don’t pay well either but the benefits could offset.  I have also considered getting a admin or fund raising job at a conservation nonprofit and working remote but they are hard to come by.  Not impossible.

career_advice,trade school,post,1dhn6ms,18M Trying to decide between Career Fields,"
I'm an 18-year-old who just graduated from high school, and I'm trying to decide between three different career paths.

My first option is Civil Engineering. I have a strong interest in this field, but I'm concerned about whether I have the necessary aptitude. While I'm not lacking intelligence, I struggled with procrastination in high school, which negatively affected my grades. I improved during my senior year and am now taking things more seriously. I scored around 1200 on the SAT and have a 2.9 cumulative GPA. This fall, I'm planning to attend community college to solidify my knowledge and improve my grades. However, I'm worried about my chances of getting into a reputable civil engineering program afterward. I could attend my state college, but they offer limited master's programs in civil engineering. Despite my concerns, my love for math and science makes this my top choice.

My second option is Accounting. I'm proficient in finance, and it’s a stable career with good pay. My only concern is the potential impact of AI on the industry. Otherwise, it offers great job opportunities and growth potential.

The third option is an Electrician Apprenticeship program. There's a local program that pays you to go to school and work part-time as an apprentice. This option is appealing because I could save my college fund and earn money while learning. However, I don't like bugs, and the physical demands of trades can be tough on the body, which worries me about my long-term career sustainability. I enjoy hands-on work, but I dislike the fatigue from hard labor. Ideally, I'd prefer working as a civil engineer.

Financial stability is crucial to me, and I want to choose a path that ensures a comfortable lifestyle. Any advice?",1,1718589754.0,

Ive decided to go back and finish school. Just so I can find a career that is a little more consistent in income. I’m an online reselller but it’s a very inconsistent income at times. I have about 100 credit hours complete. 

I’ve really been disillusioned about college. I was really looking to get a trade, specifically auto related. However I have all that school paid for but no use for it. So I decided to look at a university that has auto tech as a program you can get. They even have a bachelors degree. 

I went and talked to the advisor and she was steering me more towards just finishing a bachelors degree and not pursuing auto tech cause most of my credits wouldn’t be valid. It’s a valid point, but I’m also concerned about job availability even more than money. 

Anyways she told me to apply so we could get an idea of how my credits transfer. I haven’t been back to her yet, but have been playing online with their degree audit system and the results are just what I thought. I’m about 64% done with an English degree B.S. and 55% done with an art/design B.S. 

And about 55% done if I double major in both. 

Right now I’ve kind of given myself a few choices 

-Just do auto tech Associates to start 

-Do auto tech and one of the other two degrees 

-double major in English and design 

-Just do English or design 

Being in my 30s I’m more concerned about the economy and the current job market. None of these options are insane salary makers right now. And I’m worried about job security. Mechanics probably make the least of these but have the most job security. I also want to get my money’s worth. 

What do you all think? What makes it harder is I’ve been offered a scholarship but I must register for classes by June 15th for it to be valid. So I don’t have a lot of time. 

I enjoy all three of those things I’m just trying to make the best decision based on the current and future economy. I’ve heard that double majors can give you better opportunities possibly. Thanks

I moved companies around 6 months ago to see if it would shake things up but still no change, I live at home with my mum and sister and pay around £700 a month not including my own expenses to help out and have enough savings to cover me for a year and a little.

career_advice,skilled trade,post,187y5gf,"Feel lost with career path, looking at options","I’m a 26 year old feeling very lost with finding a career path that I am comfortable and confident in as I worry about the inevitable future and wasting my time. I’ve already felt like I’ve wasted my time in the past switching around different courses, some I passed (theatre and film design and production, graphic design) and some I failed (degree in media, degree in design technology, IT course). 

I’ve worked in some theatre and film work assisting with prop and set construction and painting but I’m tired of the inconsistency and money stress involved, especially with Covid in the past. Which is why I recently completed a graphic design course as it’s still creative but more job security. Unfortunately though it is very competitive and tough to break into, I’ve gone through almost a year of applying and no job in the industry yet, I’ve only worked at a printing job which was not inspiring. I’m learning a lot of real design work is not like the fun, creative college projects. I’m also not sure if I can stand sitting and being in front of a computer every day, I miss the prop making using hand and power tools but real living can’t offer that as regular work of course. 

I’ve been jealous of my partner as he’s an electrician, does challenging work and gets real great pay and can work anywhere with his certificates. And he does his creative music passions on the side. It’s made me wonder if I should of gone his path and do an apprenticeship to, in the future, get a well paying trade where I can be hands on and not stress about money and do my own creative projects as hobbies. I wanted to do carpentry years ago but unfortunately I’m allergic to pinewood so that’s not an option. 

I’m currently working at a signage shop making signs and assisting installations. Good people, stress free work, nice hours, hands on but it does get boring, not that challenging, some heavy lifting and feel like I wasted my graphic design skills as they already have enough designers working there. The pay is low also, I know I would be getting better pay if I did electrical or mechanical fitting or if I stuck to graphic design through years of hard long hours, practicing and updating program skills and deadlines to go from meh to better jobs. Work from home sounds very nice too. Also so so so much plastics and wastage which I get saddened by as I am passionate about nature and the environment but I like doing some of the workshop jobs, not being at a desk the whole time.

I know all jobs don’t perfectly fit with one’s expectations and values and grass can be greener, but I would appreciate suggestions based on my situation. 

Not sure to try continue getting a basic graphic design job or try work my way up in signage or start an apprenticeship in higher paying industry that align with most of my values? 

My values:

- job security
- financial stability
- creativity is my strength but maybe should be for side projects
- being fit and healthy, I like physical work but concerned about when I get older 
- I love and care for nature and the environment
- afford to travel more
- like to be busy and challenged but I get anxious too
- problem solving
- introverted and like autonomy 
- I’m good with using construction tools and adobe programs",15,1701391043.0,

If you’re interested in working onboard ships,

The fast track to being an officer onboard ships (like me) is going to a maritime academy college and getting a bachelor of science in marine engineering (with a 3rd assistant engineer license) or a bachelors of science in marine transportation aka navigation (includes a 3rd Mate unlimited License). Any graduate with one of these license is making at least 120-130k a year working only half the year on a rotation schedule, that’s starting, money goes up fast. I’ll clear 180k this year having worked only half the year on a 120 day off/on rotation. There are 7 schools that teach someone to this level in the United States they are;

- [Massachusetts Maritime Academy (where I went)](https://www.maritime.edu)

- [California Maritime Academy](http://www.csum.edu)

- [Maine Maritime Academy](https://mainemaritime.edu)

- [Texas A&M Maritime Academy](https://www.tamug.edu/corps/) (They also have a graduate/masters program for those already with a bachelors)

- [SUNY NY Maritime (they also have a graduate program where you can get a mate license for those already with bachelors degrees)](https://www.sunymaritime.edu)

- [Great Lakes Maritime](https://www.nmc.edu/maritime/)

- [Kings Point United States Merchant Marine Academy](https://www.usmma.edu). KP is free to attend but requires a navy obligation post college and I believe you have to be under 26 to apply, it’s like West Point but for the merchant marines. 

There is also a trade school that’s an excellent option if you’re thinking marine engine but it is extremely competitive because it gets you the officers license without a degree (and it’s free) the [AMO TECH Program (3rd assistant engineers license only)](https://www.star-center.com/techprogram/techprogram.html) The need for 3rd Assistant engineers is so great that my union started this program to streamline getting your officers license. Do not make this your only option, have a maritime academy as a fall back because very few people are selected for this. But of course apply! 

There are a lot of ways to enter the maritime industry starting at the bottom without going to college but the money is significantly lower such as Blue Water Maritime STOS classes or the SIU school at Piney Point.

FYI most people take federal student loans to attend college Google FAFSA but you’d pay that off fast sailing deep sea.",1,1703749425.0,kf8o6m1
career_advice,skilled trade,post,1dbakr3,"[Canada] I got a B.Eng in Electrical, but I want to pursue Software or Analyst in the industry with only 2 YOE. I have questions about doing Master's to help my career.","Hi All, 

**Academic Background**: I majored in Electrical engineering with a specialty in electronics. *My majoring institution was not a well-known university and I will ask about that in one of my questions*.  Not to bore you, but I fell out of love with electrical engineering (still graduated though), and decided to pursue software engineering as my career. I am what you can define as a jack of all trades, master of none. I did co-ops in various positions in various companies (2 of which are very notable in the industry), never gaining experience in 1 particular field in software. 

**Work Experience**: My first job out of college was in Data engineering - they provided all the training material and were patient, but got laid off due to lack of work. It took me 5 months of daily job applications - with the help of GPT4 and bard (back then) to do cover letters, write tailored resumes - and only got 1 interview which scored me my next job. My second job was at a very famous Canadian company working for their DevOps team. After a 6 month probation, I got terminated due to lack of skill. All amounts to 2 YOE, excluding Co-ops. 

**Why I think Masters:** I think Master's would be good because it would serve as an official solution to my experience-and-background gap. A 3-in-1; it would bridge the knowledge gap between EE and Software or Analyst, it would be higher than a bachelor so better job hunting, and it will specialize my skills in one particular field. I also believe (but cannot prove) that the influx of immigrants with a software background usually also take the graduate studies route and after just a year or 2 working in Canada, are eligible for 95% of Software jobs leaving the rest of us benched. I am also interested in asking about a Master's because unlike other traditional engineering routes, software is one that you can easily forgo doing a masters and take some coursers online from udemy or coursera and improve your job - so I need assurance that it is indeed a good choice to spend lots of money and time on. After all, I don't want to spend 5 months looking for work, or spend 6 months and get the boot. 

**My plan**: To go further into Software, specializing in Data Science or Software Engineering. Or get into a business analyst role.

1.  Coming with an academic background in Electronics, will a masters in comp sci or software or comp eng, help get me hired? 

2. As you may know, Engineering in Canada is accredited by the CEAB (ABET). Ontario colleges are not known to have CEAB accredited engineering degrees. However, Conestoga College in Kitchener does and I graduated with my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics Engineering from there. The program was accredited in 2014 and I think I was part of the 7th cohort. I have heard some success stories about people graduating and working at Silicon Valley. Would that be worrisome if I were to apply and they doubted that I actually have a Bachelor's in Engineering given that fact ? 

3. Same as above but for Business analyst ?

4. I don't want to get into research or PhD. Is project-based more suited to a better return to industry, compared to Thesis or coursework ? 

5. What if I can't make the minimum average cut-off, but I REALLY want to get into this program - what can be done ? 

6. Comp Sci is normally the most competitive and usually in their admission criteria, says that you need to have a background in it. If I can't meet that background because I am EE, would Comp Eng fulfill the necessities ? 

7. I have heard that Master of Computer Science is the one to get (in the U.S.) but it's a very rare title in Canada. Instead, it's MEng for project or course-based, Msc/MAsc for thesis or research (usually). I have heard from some of my friends in software that MEng has lower prestige than Msc/MAsc. Is there any truth to that? 

8. Finally, is Masters overkill for Data Analyst or Business Analyst and if I decide those paths, shall I go for some coursera certs instead ? 

Thank you all",1,1717874515.0,
career_advice,skilled trade,post,1bqeia4,Leave great job because of terrible boss?,"So I have a great job but am thinking of taking a slight career step back/sidestep due to my horrible boss. The new position would be a bit more boring/mundane, and it's not a direction most people would choose, but I'm in a tough position and am considering it.

My current job is exciting, interesting, and matches my natural skillset well. I've become somewhat of an expert in it and coworkers look to me for guidance often. I truly do enjoy it, and it's somewhat of a prestigious role/title that lots of people in the industry would like to have. If not for my boss, I'd love to continue in this roll.

But I have a boss who's a textbook narcissist. I'm generally well liked and respected in the organization, and he's often felt threatened by me. As a result, he's limited my role, limited my interactions with higher ups, diminished my accomplishments, and basically limits my opportunities to ""shine"". He's an absolute control freak and is obsessed with everything being run through him. And that's not all...

7 months ago we had an ""incident"" where he tried to humiliate me in front of coworkers about a (correct) business decision I made. I'd never been treated like that by anyone ever. It ended up going to HR and my VP (boss' boss), but it ended badly for me. It's a long story, but my boss actively, and effectively sabotaged my performance review on trumped up claims and cost me significant money on my bonus. My VP showed how spineless he was, and let it happen. Not gonna lie, it's taken a massive toll on my mental health, confidence, and life outside of work. I don't think I'd ever be able to get over it if I stayed.

Recently some new positions opened up. My current job is basically product trading/sales and logistics. The new role would be more of an accounting type ""contract administration"" role. It's a job I did years ago, and worked hard at in hopes I'd get to a job like the one I have now. Instead of selling the beans and executing a strategy, I'd be counting the beans. Less exciting for me admittedly, but also less stressful, and would allow me to learn some other skills.

I mean I think I know the answer here. It's just difficult and sad to walk away from a job I'm really great at because of a bad boss. It's a niche job as well, and I'm one of maybe like a dozen people in my mid-sized city who do it, so I can't easily jump around to different companies unless I want to uproot my family and move.

	•Job Opportunity: Finally have a job after a year of searching.

	•Experience: Gain some experience in the electrician trade.

	•Training: On-the-job learning and hopefully some future opportunities.

Cons:

	•Work environment: My friend has told me countless stories of the bad workplace environment and when asked, he said they can be an 8 out of 10 when it comes to getting roasted. He said I would need “thick skin”, which I’m gonna be honest here, I don’t really have that.

	•Low Pay: I would start at $15/hour which apparently is lower than average (I guess)

	•Personal Conflicts: My friend has told me they go to twin peaks for lunch every Friday…. And my girlfriend would not like that very much lol. Plus I wouldn’t be driving the work truck so I’m kind of screwed there.

	•Working with my old friend : I would be working closely with a former toxic friend, which I had issues with, and my girlfriend really dislikes him. He’s not a good person but he’s friends with my other friends…

I have an associates degree in Automotive Technology(Basically electrical side of car industry) and an associates in human behavioral science(genuinely don't know how I got this degree) . Right now I am deciding on 3 career paths. I've dabbled in a few career fields. I have ""decent"" electrical knowledge as I know ""enough"" to wire up a car and tuning(ECU, A/F ratio, fuel tables, ignition tables). I did 2 years of nursing major in college(it was alright). I also have a decent knowledge in computers(not coding). My current job is physical security. I sit in a room and watch the cameras by myself and noone bothers me, literally. Paid 21/hr.

Here are the career paths and how long it would take to complete

1. Electrician(join through IBEW union, paid apprenticeship starts at 21/hr and caps out at 45/hr, about 4-5 years to become licensed and make +52/hr)
2. Registered Nurse/ADN(will probably take another 3 years to complete and get an associates degree, starting pay is above 40/hr, no limit on top salary)
3. Cybersecurity(If I go this route I will have an associates degree and comptia certs finished in 6 months, starting pay is around +20/hr, no limit on top salary)

As an adult, line up something new before you bail, either enroll in school or line up a new gig.

A degree doesn’t really mean too much, but tech pays well. Don’t go in debt if you don’t have to… you could be getting certificates on your own time with a day job if you really wanted.

And finally, electricians aren’t going to have their jobs stolen by AI.

Maybe give it 3 months, that’s what a typical trial period is. Going to bed early and waking up early and hard physical work take getting used to. But is the environment alright? These are skills you could have as a side gig for life if you stick through it. Plus you get off early right? 1:30-2pm?

career_advice,electrician,post,1dhn6ms,18M Trying to decide between Career Fields,"
I'm an 18-year-old who just graduated from high school, and I'm trying to decide between three different career paths.

My first option is Civil Engineering. I have a strong interest in this field, but I'm concerned about whether I have the necessary aptitude. While I'm not lacking intelligence, I struggled with procrastination in high school, which negatively affected my grades. I improved during my senior year and am now taking things more seriously. I scored around 1200 on the SAT and have a 2.9 cumulative GPA. This fall, I'm planning to attend community college to solidify my knowledge and improve my grades. However, I'm worried about my chances of getting into a reputable civil engineering program afterward. I could attend my state college, but they offer limited master's programs in civil engineering. Despite my concerns, my love for math and science makes this my top choice.

My second option is Accounting. I'm proficient in finance, and it’s a stable career with good pay. My only concern is the potential impact of AI on the industry. Otherwise, it offers great job opportunities and growth potential.

The third option is an Electrician Apprenticeship program. There's a local program that pays you to go to school and work part-time as an apprentice. This option is appealing because I could save my college fund and earn money while learning. However, I don't like bugs, and the physical demands of trades can be tough on the body, which worries me about my long-term career sustainability. I enjoy hands-on work, but I dislike the fatigue from hard labor. Ideally, I'd prefer working as a civil engineer.

Financial stability is crucial to me, and I want to choose a path that ensures a comfortable lifestyle. Any advice?",1,1718589754.0,

Going to try to have the attitude of ""this is the last summer for me, so lets have fun and try to enjoy it - go out with class"". I've got a decent savings pile in a worst case scenario, but nothing is beneath me work-wise, so I'm hoping to dip into it minimally during the retraining phase.

I'm in relatively good fitness for the norm in my field, which I plan to maintain and continue going into any new job, feels great and will hopefully help my ""retirement"" years to be something I can actually enjoy.

career_advice,electrician,post,1cfr9d9,Electrical apprentice thinking about making a change,"So I’m a 25 year old electrical apprentice from Toronto. I’ll be licensed within 2 years but I’ve recently been having a bit of a quarter life crises and I’m starting to think I might wanna change careers. There’s alot to love about being an electrician and the trades in general such as :

- Great pay, benefits, and pension (journeyman’s package is worth $75 an hour everything included)
- We can work as much or as little as we want (we don’t ask for time off we just tell them when we’re not gonna be there)
- Usually are left alone with a task, not very much micro managing 

But there are a few things I’ve grown to really dislike about it too:
- Insane commute times. Anywhere from 45 minutes each way to 2 hours each way. This means you usually leave the house at 4:30 and get home at 4:30. Basically 12 hour days 
- Having the same sleep schedule as a toddler because again waking up at 4:30 so need to be in bed early unless you want to live on 5 hours of sleep permanently. 
- Lack of downtime at work. This might seem like a weird one. But all of my friends who didn’t go into trades just have way more downtime at work than we do. I’m expected to be producing every hour of the day if I’m not on break. Whereas my friend’s careers it seems you might have an hour here or there of just downtime especially if you work from home. A lot of my friends who work from home say they don’t really work more than 4 hours a day. 
- Monday to Friday 9-5 consistency. I find the monotonous day in and out of a 9-5 brutal. Maybe this is more me than the job but i just hate working 5 days a week M to F. It’s impossible to do doctors appointments or oil changes or anything else when you work the exact same schedule as all those places plus commute on top. Then on the weekend when you have time off, everyone else is off as well so anything you’d want to do is packed full of people. 
- The physical toll and the danger. This one is kinda self explanatory. I’m an electrician so definitely not as physical as some trades jobs but there are definitely physically hard days and lots of old guys with busted backs,knees, etc. Also have to consider the damage to the lungs from being around so much dust and other toxic shit. Every old guy also has a story about almost dying, or seeing a guy die or get seriously injured on site. It didn’t bother me when I was younger but the older I get the more I realize I don’t want to die at work just trying to feed my family. 
- Work life balance. So because of the culture of the trades and the insane commute times through the week you basically just work. You leave the house at 4:30 and are home around 4:30 that gives you 5 hours after work. You still have to shower and eat dinner. Not to mention how tired you are from work and the commute. It just seems like M to F has to be exclusively work time and that just doesn’t leave a lot of time for other things. 


So do you think I’m crazy to change careers based on what I laid out above? I understand I’m on track to make a lot of money with no student loan debt and retire at 60 with a fat pension. But I’m not so sure the lifestyle I have to live for the next 40 years is really worth it. If I changed careers I’d want something wfh or hybrid, making atleast 100k year, and ideally something with a somewhat flexible schedule. I want random Tuesdays off so I can go to the gym when it isn’t packed, I want to not wake up at 5am to drive over an hour to work, I want to have a life outside of work during the week. Honestly if I could just sit in front of a computer and punch numbers into spreadsheets that would be great. Does this job exist? Is this reasonable? Any idea what jobs I should be looking at? I understand what I’m describing is more of a senior role with a 4 year degree and that’s fine. I’m willing to go back to school and put in a few years in office if it means I can have the kind of job I want in the end.

career_advice,electrician,comment,1cfr9d9,,"It's not your  career that's making you unhappy, it's *this job.*  That commute would ruin any job.  Can you find something closer to home?

What if you take some fridays off?

A buddy retired as an electrician (USA) and has a nice pension. I'm envious of that. Otherwise you have to ""earn your own money"" in retirement.  It's hard to have that be a motivator when you're younger though.

career_advice,electrician,comment,1cfr9d9,,"Thanks for taking the time to give your input. There’s not much I can do about the commute because job sites are constantly changing as we start new ones and finish others. The attitude in the trades is very much “we go where the work is” even to the extent that a lot of guys travel nearly full time if their local doesn’t have any work. The only way to get a consistent commute would be to go into maintenance but to do that id have to leave the union forfeiting my pension and take a severe pay cut (probably somewhere around 50%). These jobs are also hard to come by as typically once’s guys are in these roles they stay there for their whole career.

As for the taking time off. That is true in a broader sense but not on a week to week basis. Taking weeks to months at a time off is pretty accepted. A lot of guys either take all winter or all summer off and work 6 months of the year (this is also something I’ve seriously considered doing after getting my license). But taking a day here and there is way less accepted. An appointment here or there every couple months is okay but definitely not multiple days a month. It’s honestly probably the fastest way to get yourself laid off. Getting laid off is not a big deal because you just go back to the union and go back to work for another contractor but still defeats the point of trying to just take one or two days off. 


Unfortunately some things like the commute, the work life balance, and the danger are just unavoidable in the trades.

I know after I get certified for ASE , I can look for an entry level job being I will only be certified and need to get that experience, luckily for me though the local dealerships around me offer apprenticeships for the school I’m attending, I was between becoming a mechanic, construction worker (which I didn’t wanna break my back by the time I’m 35) and lastly an electrician , which I didn’t really feel like was something I wanted to pursue. I just honestly feel like even though I feel like I know what I want to do , I really don’t know. So if there are any workers from the three fields I’ve mentioned above, is your career worth it? I’m not looking for an insane income , I want a good balanced job that I enjoy. I will mention I do have a semi passion for cars just started getting into them as they are fascinating machines.

I can also further my education with ford FACT , Honda PACT or whichever dealership with other programs they offer. I always loved Hondas as the accord is my favorite model , but I feel like I would enjoy working at ford. I’m sure both offer ideal benefits and discounts on vehicles if they even do that.

I’m in the fourth year of my PhD and just passed my quals (2nd try). I’m miserable.

I’ve already felt like I’ve wasted my time in the past switching around different courses, some I passed (theatre and film design and production, graphic design) and some I failed (degree in media, degree in design technology, IT course). 

I’ve worked in some theatre and film work assisting with prop and set construction and painting but I’m tired of the inconsistency and money stress involved, especially with Covid in the past. Which is why I recently completed a graphic design course as it’s still creative but more job security. Unfortunately though it is very competitive and tough to break into, I’ve gone through almost a year of applying and no job in the industry yet, I’ve only worked at a printing job which was not inspiring. I’m learning a lot of real design work is not like the fun, creative college projects. I’m also not sure if I can stand sitting and being in front of a computer every day, I miss the prop making using hand and power tools but real living can’t offer that as regular work of course. 

I’ve been jealous of my partner as he’s an electrician, does challenging work and gets real great pay and can work anywhere with his certificates. And he does his creative music passions on the side. It’s made me wonder if I should of gone his path and do an apprenticeship to, in the future, get a well paying trade where I can be hands on and not stress about money and do my own creative projects as hobbies. I wanted to do carpentry years ago but unfortunately I’m allergic to pinewood so that’s not an option. 

I’m currently working at a signage shop making signs and assisting installations. Good people, stress free work, nice hours, hands on but it does get boring, not that challenging, some heavy lifting and feel like I wasted my graphic design skills as they already have enough designers working there. The pay is low also, I know I would be getting better pay if I did electrical or mechanical fitting or if I stuck to graphic design through years of hard long hours, practicing and updating program skills and deadlines to go from meh to better jobs. Work from home sounds very nice too. Also so so so much plastics and wastage which I get saddened by as I am passionate about nature and the environment but I like doing some of the workshop jobs, not being at a desk the whole time.

I know all jobs don’t perfectly fit with one’s expectations and values and grass can be greener, but I would appreciate suggestions based on my situation. 

Not sure to try continue getting a basic graphic design job or try work my way up in signage or start an apprenticeship in higher paying industry that align with most of my values? 

My values:

- job security
- financial stability
- creativity is my strength but maybe should be for side projects
- being fit and healthy, I like physical work but concerned about when I get older 
- I love and care for nature and the environment
- afford to travel more
- like to be busy and challenged but I get anxious too
- problem solving
- introverted and like autonomy 
- I’m good with using construction tools and adobe programs",15,1701391043.0,

If you’re interested in working onboard ships,

The fast track to being an officer onboard ships (like me) is going to a maritime academy college and getting a bachelor of science in marine engineering (with a 3rd assistant engineer license) or a bachelors of science in marine transportation aka navigation (includes a 3rd Mate unlimited License). Any graduate with one of these license is making at least 120-130k a year working only half the year on a rotation schedule, that’s starting, money goes up fast. I’ll clear 180k this year having worked only half the year on a 120 day off/on rotation. There are 7 schools that teach someone to this level in the United States they are;

- [Massachusetts Maritime Academy (where I went)](https://www.maritime.edu)

- [California Maritime Academy](http://www.csum.edu)

- [Maine Maritime Academy](https://mainemaritime.edu)

- [Texas A&M Maritime Academy](https://www.tamug.edu/corps/) (They also have a graduate/masters program for those already with a bachelors)

- [SUNY NY Maritime (they also have a graduate program where you can get a mate license for those already with bachelors degrees)](https://www.sunymaritime.edu)

- [Great Lakes Maritime](https://www.nmc.edu/maritime/)

- [Kings Point United States Merchant Marine Academy](https://www.usmma.edu). KP is free to attend but requires a navy obligation post college and I believe you have to be under 26 to apply, it’s like West Point but for the merchant marines. 

There is also a trade school that’s an excellent option if you’re thinking marine engine but it is extremely competitive because it gets you the officers license without a degree (and it’s free) the [AMO TECH Program (3rd assistant engineers license only)](https://www.star-center.com/techprogram/techprogram.html) The need for 3rd Assistant engineers is so great that my union started this program to streamline getting your officers license. Do not make this your only option, have a maritime academy as a fall back because very few people are selected for this. But of course apply! 

There are a lot of ways to enter the maritime industry starting at the bottom without going to college but the money is significantly lower such as Blue Water Maritime STOS classes or the SIU school at Piney Point.

FYI most people take federal student loans to attend college Google FAFSA but you’d pay that off fast sailing deep sea.",1,1703749425.0,kf8o6m1
career_advice,plumber,post,161xllz,Chef or Plumber apprenticeship?,"I have the opportunity to do either trade as an apprentice. The thing is is that I'm not too sure about the plumbing apprenticeship because I used to work in construction as a labourer and out of all the other trades such as painters, tilers, electricians, engineers, bricklayers you name it- plumbers were always the lease happiest people to be on-site they would never be the first people to say hello and they wouldn't look like they was enjoying their job. It was more of a chore for them.. I know the apprentices absolutely hate their job when they have to dig a hole all day and it doesn't look like much fun stuffing around with a single pipe for 3 hours a day. the things that attract me to plumbing is the good pay minimum 45$ an hour after at least 3 years.. and as for the chef apprenticeship it sounds much more fun as i do love to cook but I've also heard that it only pays $27 an hour which is far less than a plumber but in my personal opinion it's a better job in the air-conditioning.. (I'm from Aussie) have I misjudged my fellow workmates on site and is it actually a good trade to be a plumber?

career_advice,plumber,comment,1b6lfji,,"Stay at your job and look into trade schools near you. My brother got a cert for welding from trade school: the upside is how quickly you can obtain cert and how much cheaper it is compared to a bachelor’s degree. The downside (that others have mentioned below) is health concerns. At my brother’s first job, they didn’t even supply him a mask: he had to buy and bring his own. His health has gotten worse, notably his breathing. If you stick with welding, make sure whomever you work for follows guidelines and doesn’t shortcut. Make sure it’s a spot that doesn’t hire welders uncertified (like my brother’s first job did). Always wear your mask! And if you smoke/are overweight, expect even more health issues to come along the way, as well as shortness of breath.

I don’t mean this to deter you from pursuing welding at all; just be aware of the risks. If you feel comfortable with them, definitely go ahead! And you can always look at other opportunities that trade schools offer (plumbing, carpentry, even IT certs). I’m currently trying to transition out of the elementary ed sphere, so I get how difficult it can be jumping from one industry to the next.

It’s good because it makes me better at my craft but at the same time wasting my life. With welding it’s a skill, it takes years off practice to make $100 an hour. You can make good money but don’t be disappointed when you’re earning the same as a 16 year old for a few years. People want experience not knowledge when working in a trade. Also it depends on what type of welding you go into, welding steel is pretty simple but aluminium welding or even titanium welding is pure skill. But you can make big bucks especially for custom work as it’s a constant need especially in motorcycles or cars. 

You also need to think about can you do it for the next 30 years and most of the time the answer is no.

Hey this is kind of a long one but i need help thanks. Im a 25M who as been working as a butcher since i was 17 didn’t have other meaningful jobs in between. Im not freelancing as a butcher for different store since theres a lack of employees. Im not maxed out i am being paid 31$/h CAD  but here’s why i need help

I feel like im not where i should be ive been hating my job for a while but have no scholarship dropped out at 14 to become a car mechanic and didnt enjoy that either

The biggest issue in finding a new path for a future career is when i was 15 i got hospitalized for a year because of a skateboard accident that created a massive problem for my height. I have a poor back missing a couple of pads in my lower back part and have hips issue so sometimes at the end of the day or 6h in my legs and back feel like concrete 

Obviously i want to find something im happy with and exciting or varied  i only started as a butcher because it was my only option at the time. Most butcher are paid 20$/h so im lucky sure

But i cant stand going home to my wife just to feel like a total loser anymore since i dont feel any importance in what im doing. If being a attentive and good husband was a job then i would be settled for life

I want to find something else for sure but for exemple something that was aligning with my personal talents would be starting bartending 

But 1 that wouldn’t be a good life path on the long run. And 2 i would have to lose a massive amount of sleep just to spend quality time with my wife

findapath,technician,post,17k0yeq,Which one would you choose from these two? Radiology Technician or Dental Hygienist,"I swear I'm addicted to this sub I post almost everyday lmaoo but I have paralysis anxiety or whatever it's called where if i'm not 100% sure I just end up doing nothing. But anyway, I think I'm narrowing down on what I want to do and I am stuck on these two. Here's my pros and cons

Ok dental hygiene, this was my top choice at first because dentistry is sort of a passion but it's scaling thing everyday so I'm sure the passion will wear out eventually so I don't want to rely on passion that much but like I love dentistry 

**Dental Hygiene Pros:** 

\- Stable income (average 81k, 105k in my state)

\-Love the idea of being a dental hygienist 

\-I can work part-time (i want to work part-time)

\-Just dental cleaning, yes patient's don't like going to the dentists but at least they are healthy and not having medical emergencies 

**Dental Hygiene Cons:**

\-Not a real career I guess? From what I'm reading no employers give health insurance or 401k (big one for me i think, do I have to buy my own health care? prob more expensive right? Will I never retire or what)

\-Musculoskeletal problems, carpal tunnel from weird postures and repetitive movement

\-I don't remember what else but all the hygienist over at r/DentalHygiene want to kill themselves apparently

\-No career advancement, always the same thing 

 **Radiology Tech Pros:**

\-Stable but lower income (average 65k, 97k in my state)

\-From what I read I can work 3 12 hr shifts which I also like. I just dont want M-F, 9-5

\-Since I will be working in a hospital or clinic, there is healthcare insurance and 401k

\-I can imagine it is physically demanding but I have not heard of musculoskeletal problems to the extent they mention them in dental hygiene

\-Can move into ct, mri, and other diagnostic imaging fields 

**Radiology Tech Cons:**

\-yes it sounds interesting too but not my passion at all 

\-Might become emotionally draining if I have to take x-rays of like half-dead people all the time and I have to see a bunch of gory shit 

 

That's all I can think of, if anyone knows any other pros and cons of these two careers that I am missing please let me know and tell me which one you would choose if you were me thank you

Personally I'm hoping to be able to travel  in order to make more money and have my housing paid for and what not! Every traveling nurse i have ever meet or worked (through the military) with seems very happy, successful and secure in their job. So I'm assuming traveling Radiological thech would be a similar outcome. 

&#x200B;

As for the concern about being around sick/dying patients and worrying about the emotional tole is very reasonable!

 I'm taking the approach of: I know that my mother, grandparents, and older siblings are all most likely going to die and get sick before me and I want to be there for them in that time. So putting in the work of learning how to be there for people and help them can only really benefit me and everyone involved.

findapath,technician,post,153qxip,Perplexity of a Photographer Transitioning to Become a Heavy Equipment Technician,"Hello everyone,

I am a photographer from China, and the purpose of this letter is to seek advice on the ""heavy equipment technician"" profession. Yes, I am a photographer, and my wife is an illustrator. We are about to embark on a new journey in Canada after turning 30.

My first impression of Canada was influenced by the Yukon map from Age of Empires III, with its vast land, maple leaves, and the rich indigenous culture deeply captivating me. Canada's broad tolerance was the decisive factor in our decision to immigrate. Regarding immigration, I have chosen to study at a college, and my wife will apply for an open work permit as my spouse. As my language test results have just been released, my options for program selection were limited.

Considering that my current career in the film and television industry is somewhat related to blue-collar work, where artistic attributes only account for half of the job, I have chosen the heavy equipment technician program. Luckily, Cambrian College has already sent me a conditional offer letter within a day. My thoughts on this profession are as follows: it involves driving, maintaining, and servicing heavy machinery used in various industries such as forestry, mining, petroleum, and construction. It is a science-oriented discipline, but it also emphasizes hands-on skills, logical thinking, and physical fitness. I am genuinely interested in this career, as it offers travel opportunities and outdoor work, similar to my experiences as a photographer, having traveled to all provinces in China and even to the African continent.

However, I am aware that this profession highly values experience, and it is a completely unfamiliar field for me. I don't have anyone around me who works in this area. I would like to seek your advice on a few questions:

1. Are there any alumni who have graduated from the heavy equipment technician program at Cambrian College, or anyone who knows about this program? I would appreciate your evaluation of the courses in this field.
2. Is this a good entry point for someone like me who has no prior experience in this field?
3. I have also applied for programs such as Forestry Technician, Prospecting Technician, Fish and Wildlife Technician, and Carpentry. Can you provide a comparison among these occupations?

I sincerely look forward to your responses.",1,1689761771.0,

I don't want to dox myself too bad but I work in a Semiconductor field as a high level technician. I have worked here for almost a decade and done quite well in the job. I am the most skilled and most senior and have enjoyed it for a while. I no longer like the work schedule (nights n weekends) and, overall, the company is doing poorly. 

I started looking at nearby schools that offer certificate programs of other tech related industries but I get overwhelmed with trying to find out what certificate is worth it's weight and if that just means 4 more years of school. I know 40 is not too old to go back to school but I still have loans to pay and I never got a 4 year degree to begin with.

findapath,technician,post,15pz8wl,Are there careers similar to a Radiology Technician that are not so difficult to get into?,"Back when I graduated high school I was very interested a career as a Radiology Technician. The work, technology, and only being a 2 year program really appealed to me. It would also give me the option to further my education by specializing in a certain area. And it was a career that would allow me to go and live pretty much anywhere. The problem was that it was extremely competitive. The one program available to me in my state accepted only 15 students each year. I had a scholarship that paid fully for any in-state school, so that was my only option. I did not get accepted into the program the first year I applied, so I took all the required college courses my first year of college to prove my capability and dedication. I got straight A's and had essentially already completed half of the program, but still did not get accepted. I felt like there was nothing else I could do.

Not wanting to waste my scholarship, I got a degree in Computer Science and ended up hating it. I worked as a developer for a few years after graduating and I was so stressed and miserable. I have worked other unrelated jobs since then, but I feel like I am never getting anywhere. I am 32 now. I have been thinking a lot about going back to school. I want to try for the radiology program again, but I don't have much faith that I will get in. Are there any other careers that are similar that are not as difficult to get into? For what it's worth, I am male. I know that these career fields are more female-dominant and I'm certain that was a factor in me not getting accepted my first time around. Given that these programs are usually like 95% girls right out of high school, I don't think being a man in his 30s will help my case.",6,1691934138.0,

I am running out of options since I haven't finished my degree and don't want to do food service or retail.,3,1695610469.0,
findapath,technician,comment,16rgkc5,,"My wife did this for a while (assuming you're talking about an RBT, the technician working under an ABA). She didn't feel comfortable with it, and she had enrolled in an ABA masters program and her experience caused her to withdraw and do a different masters.

The ABA's didn't seem to actually understand reinforcement, so they would often provide generic plans for her to do. As the RBT, you basically have to run the program the way the ABA lays it out, but  there were many days where my wife had to basically scrap it because the treatment was so useless.

You're probably referring to people with ASD reflecting on ABA interventions. The main criticism stems from the idea that the person, and the mind, is a black box, so the ""applied behavior analysis"" is responding to behaviors without a holistic view of the person. Often these kids are trucked from school to occupational therapy to ABA and they're basically exhausted by their parents trying to ""make them normal"".

In one case she had, candy was being used as reinforcers, and the kid had so much sugar over the course of the day, that he threw up during the session. Wasn't sick, just literally full of chocolate milk and skittles because the parents were told they're reinforcers; which is insane. There's no chance this kid will have physical health with all the sugar they're pumping him with.

All that being said, you would very likely end up working with kids with ASD. The work itself can be very rewarding and you can make progress with them. My wife really liked the kids she worked with and was sad when she left the job. However, just know that the clinic or the ABA handling the case might not give a single shit about the child, and just throw generic activities at them because they can bill insurance or medicaid either way. If you worked with a GOOD ABA, it would make a big difference, but, especially starting out, you won't have much control over that. I would just go see what it's like, if possible. I wouldn't try to talk anybody out of it, it's just got a lot of aspects you can't control (the parents, the clinic management, the ABA, the kids you get assigned).",3,1695612155.0,k238h8p

I will say that right now you can earn pretty good money as a copywriter that trains AI. You answer prompts, fact check, make sure AI is responding to the prompt appropriately. 

Also, if you do copywriting, many people will use AI and then have you edit it, which is faster and easier than writing it yourself. I think there's going to continue to be a fair amount of jobs for writers, it's just going to look very different than it has in the past.

If we look back in human history lot of things got simpler just because of tools. Lets take an example of art since that is the area which got affected the most. In the past people used to draw pictures in caves. Abstract yet definite. Then paintings. Then different media related to art. Then advent of computers. Then software to help create digital art. More advanced tools in the software. Now AI is generating art. If you look at the aI art today, (Atleast I feel this way) its sort of repetitive , monotonous and lacks taste. It is lacking that feeling of humanness. Its not as appreciated as the creative endevours of past. So for AI correct prompts are still necessary to create magnificense. Its just that creative display is shown in a different area. AI for now is a very efficient tool. Thats all.   

Just dont worry. More repetitive, effort intensive tasks only will be done by AI. It is not true intelligence as the name suggests.

findapath,technician,comment,1bb0925,,"I’m willing to share some stories, but I really must reiterate that this isn’t a field you want to go into. The turnover rate for these jobs is insanely high for a reason. 


I worked for a nonprofit residential treatment and foster care facility. It was lauded by the community for its work within the community, but the administration was insanely corrupt. Half of our funding went to bonuses for the “inner circle,” of administrators, old ladies that had been there for 10 years in the office. This caused us to go without critical resources (LIKE FOOD) a good many times.


We had several buildings on our property that housed clients. When I started, 3 were classed as level 4, the highest a non-clinical setting can be classed. 2 of those facilities were locked; that means every single door had a lock with the exception of the bathrooms for clients and their bedroom doors.


During my time in the first building I worked in, the all-boys building, I was stabbed twice in the abdomen. The first time penetrated almost an inch. The second time didn’t go as deep because the kid who stabbed me had sweaty hands from engaging us in hand-to-hand combat for 45 minutes prior.  We were not allowed to do anything except physical restraints (with nurse and supervisor present) so a lot of days boiled down to us literally running from our lives until a supervisor could be located, which was hard because the other locked building was just as busy. I got moved from that building because it closed due to a lawsuit.

In the interim, my coworker’s throat was slit on Christmas Eve. When we finally got her off the floor and a cop in the building, the client that slit my coworker’s throat managed to wrestle the cop with the help of another client and was able to unholster and discharge his weapon into the floor. They, of course, went to jail, but the fallout of this incident directly impacted everyone who was present for this for a long time. A lot of those clients were quietly transferred to new facilities.


Later, I was assigned to a lower level of care. This is usually less stress, but thanks to the oversights of our corrupt administration and a corrupt local government, we received 2 kids who did not meet the criteria for level 3, but were placed in our care anyway. One, a boy I’ll call A, was so incredibly violent that he shattered the skull of my coworker with a heavy chair. He also totaled the car parked next to mine with a cinder block. He caused over $100,000 of property damage during his 2 months there, at a time where I was the only adult in charge of 4 teenagers because all of my coworkers had quit. I worked with this group for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 2 months straight. I received a cardstock award and a $15 Amazon gift card as compensation. My time with A nearly ruined my relationship with my wife, as I came home insanely late and had nearly no desire to be intimate. Luckily, we worked together at the time so she knew what I was going through.


Near the end of my tenure, I participated in an improper restraint that should have been called off or I should not have participated in. A rather large kid with low-functioning autism targeted me. Long story short, we had to restrain him, but due to his size (he was over 6ft tall and was rather fit) I had to hold his legs. Being that he was quite strong, he slammed me against the ground repeatedly. Unfortunately, thanks to the fact that most people who sign up to be mental health counselors are feminine in muscular structure, I had no one I could swap with. So I ended the encounter with a hairline fracture in one of my neck vertebrae that required extensive recovery. My facility never filed the workers comp forms as the HR lady quit that morning. I spent over 2 years fighting them and the hospital to have that covered until I finally said “fuck y’all it’s up to you,” and stopped answering the calls from the medical debtors.


I have a LOT of stories of heartache and grief, watching these horribly abused and unwell kids behave in ways that reflected their individual situations. I spent many many hours holding the bloodied hands of kids that slit their wrists while we waited for ambulances to arrive. I have cried with clients after phone calls with their case workers telling them that their parents weren’t coming to see them for the 6th consecutive month. I have more stories that I’m unwilling to recall and reflect upon because of how much pain they still cause me. I will never EVER promote this line of work to anyone. The pay is horrific, the pain is unbearable and the entire system is too corrupt to change unless it’s burnt to the ground first.",5,1710119066.0,kuaxy4q

After all, we have had similar situations in the past: There was, for example, the industrial revolution. Some time later, with quite a bit of engineering to produce smarter machinery, lots of skilled weavers lost their jobs.

All of a sudden, textiles also became much cheaper, and much more affordable for everyone.

Was that a good thing, or not?

Of course factory owners earned themselves a golden nose through the exploitation of their workforce.

In response to all of that, along came a guy called Marx, who pointed out some of the problems which this development has caused, and some possible solutions on how to tackle it. It's not my fault that socialism in its many forms is underappreciated nowadays. Solutions to associated problems exist.

So, the idea that AI, or an increase in productivity, is not good, is what I would call laughable at best.

Ahhh removal of damaged nerves is root canal treatment. Yes, it takes approximately 8 years to become a dentist (4 undergrad + 4 dental school unless you finish your undergrad courses in less time). As a dentist you can do pretty much any procedure you are comfortable with but you can specialize afterwards. You can specialize in root canals (endodontics). Also, specialists are paid/reimbursed more as well. So say a general dentist and an endodontist both do the same procedure on the same tooth. The endodontist will make more since he has a specialty certification. To become an endodontist, it is an extra 3 years of schooling. oral surgery (OMFS) is 6 extra years lol.

We really are not making booku bucks. Like I said, I'm debt free (thank God) so I can choose to only work 3 days a week and take home a decent pay (also not married, no GF, no children, and live at home).

If I could do it all over, I might have attempted some type of engineering because I like creating/building. My one hobby is woodworking and I want to get into metalworking and welding as well.

What kept me from going the engineering route was the high-level math courses required for the degree. I did not want to start and then fail out or not be able to finish the degree and then start all over again.

In elementary school, that equates to a gap in those who know their alphabets, those who can read a level one book. If they make it to college, that equates to adults who don’t know how to do anything for themselves educationally, because they were simply moved through the grades after graded on presence, but ultimately and intrinsically failed by the people who were “supposed” to have taught them. 

Ai can’t teach what parents won’t, and what teachers aren’t there to instill.

findapath,technician,post,1acj4oe,PSA On Trades,"I've been seeing a lot of posts referencing ""the trades"" that seem to indicate that a lot of people think ""trades"" are either just construction, plumbing, and electrical (as in a residential electrician), and/or that people who go into the trade are unskilled or uneducated. This is simply not true, and there is so much more to the trades! (Of course, construction workers, electricians, and plumbers are fine people in important lines of work)

Though I cannot provide an exhaustive list of trades, I will list some overlooked professions within the trades:

- Advanced Manufacturing Technician
- Machinist
- Machine Operator
- Heavy Equipment Operator
- Quality Inspector
- Automation Technician
- Carpenter
- Home Inspector
- Commercial Service Technician
- Owner / Operator
- Dispatcher
- Security Professional
- Porter
- Millwright
- Productions Engineer/Technician
- Die Setter
- Landscaper
- Installer
- Fitter

Honestly, the list goes on. Many of these jobs can be started with little to no experience, and many of them offer decent pay. Almost all of them, though, offer upward mobility, job security, union benefits, and high pay with gained experience, education, and training. Some of them require you to enter the field with some sort of licensure or credentialing. A few of them require a degree. None of them are to be looked down on as ALL of them are necessary and can provide opportunities to people. 

Yes, you find people in the trades who aren't traditional or conventionally intelligent. Yes, you find lazy people in the trades. But you also find Machine operators with MBAs, and tool truck owners that have passed the bar exam. You also find physicians who are antisocial, college professors who think WWII happened in the 1950'-1960's, and egineers who can't spell.

I'm 38 and followed a path out of college of laboratory research fellow -> startup co-founder -> laboratory automation engineer -> startup co-founder -> sole proprietor web developer. Most of my 'career' was spent engaging with CEO's and business owners and PIs, and now I've taken on a role as a biomedical technician at a hospital. Previously I guess I had some ego wrapped up in being at the top of the food chain, and now I'm thrown into this environment for the 'first time' that is all wrapped up in hierarchy. There's the biomedical technicians (level I and II, I'm a I), then the clinical engineers, then a chief clinical engineer, then a director. That's just our department. The chatter amongst my colleagues and stuff just makes me feel like a worthless peon. This is mean to say, but my entire life I've wrapped my self-worth up in my education and career, which drove me to succeed, and now I'm basically one step up from the hospital cleaning staff on the career-social-caste ladder. It hurts the ego. No idea what to say except I sorta feel dead and wish I did not. Maybe I'm just blaming the job. Maybe it's a mid-life crisis.",3,1711735248.0,

Any job that’s that easy/low maintenance may not even pay you enough to get by. There’s definitely no degree you can get that guarantees many eight-hour stretches with only a few hours of work.

You should be thinking in terms of what you can do that won’t be so agonizing that you’re having trouble getting through the day. Maybe even something you love (although even then, there will be parts of the job you don’t like). 

Many community colleges have personnel/departments that will help you figure out what that is (a career counselor can also help with this, but you’d have to pay). You may be able to find some online aptitude tests, but you have to make sure they’re legit. Ultimately you know yourself and what you can be relatively happy doing.

Whoever you go to for help with this, you also have to ask about how in demand those skills are, how easy it is to break into the career, how much money you can make, etc.

If you don’t feel like doing all that, you can just see what kinds of jobs your experience qualifies you for. Maybe you can apply for warehouse management positions or talk to your employer about more responsibility. Another option might be logistics, depending on your warehouse experience. I understand this is pretty much the exact opposite of what you say you want, but you’re going to have to get through a barrier of *some* kind if you want to get out of what you’re doing now.

That doesn't pay well. But working in one of the large bank buildings.

I personally think having an accounting degree is probably the best degree to try to get into one of these jobs. I think a second choice is a finance degree.

I want to state this. Now is the time to pursue this. I started back at the community college when I was 31. Did all but one class for an AA there before transferring to the four year university and finishing out. Altogether it took about six years while working full time. I could have gone faster but I got busy with work for a while and took a break between the community college and the four year university.

Onto actual classes. If you sign up for business classes at the community college then you'll probably need to take introductory accounting and economics classes. If you do better in accounting then pursue an accounting degree. If you do better in economics then pursue a finance degree. In my case I had a wonderful economics teacher and fell in love with it. I ended up double majoring in finance and economics. My first accounting teacher was this very nice old man. But it was an 8:00 am class and he was so boring. I didn't do as well in that class(maybe a B). Anyway, that's how I ended up pursuing Finance and Econ. But I can tell you I'm searching for jobs now and I see accounting degrees being valued more often than other business degrees. That's nothing new. It's been that way for at least forty years that I know of. However, there are lots of jobs looking for finance, management, or other business degrees. It may be a little easier to pursue a management degree. But finance really isn't hard. Some of the economics electives can get a little difficult. You have to be pretty decent at math with some of them.

Agreed. But do not take a bootcamp or try to be self taught in coding. It is a lot less viable of an option nowadays. If you want that software engineering job you'll want to get a Bachelors in Computer Science or related field (like computer engineering). Also having an internship to put down as experience is really important when just getting started. I don't want to discourage anyone from taking this route, I just want to be realistic with people who want to go down this path. People like to try to make this path seem easier than it really is by presenting easy 6 month bootcamps. But they will likely just waste your time and money.

I think the flexibility to watch your kids simultaneously, or take breaks and pick up your kids, or do the laundry in the afternoon, or anything else that’s truly “schedule your work around your life” will likely result in you not putting in 8 hours a day.

The only way around that is if you work late, every day.  If you roll into work at 9am and leave at 8 or 9pm because you shuttled the kids somewhere in the afternoon, it works fine.  My gut tells me that most people don’t want it that way.  They want to work 9-5 while also taking off an hour in the afternoon to shuttle the kids or even worse, “watch the kids” while they “work” at the same time.

If I’m hiring for a job, I’m hiring someone to put in 40 hours at 100% of their capacity for the week.  I don’t believe most people can be at 100% while also molding your job around your life.  There are certainly counter examples but I’d guess that’s not the norm.",1,1690240199.0,jtbb6ew

findapath,blue collar,comment,15843uu,,"Good point, scratch data entry for those reasons. Help desk would be the 0 experience route. They’re always hiring and if you can use a computer you’re qualified.

An entry level cyber or sysadmin job would likely require either a 4 year degree in CS or some related IT degree, or 2+ years of relevant IT experience. That’s where help desk comes in, as the generic IT work you do there arguably prepares you better for those bigger IT jobs than college does (and you make money doing it instead of spending money on a degree). A lot of cyber work is people/compliance related, and the technical stuff is tool/company-specific where you’re trained on the job. I see degrees in this space as nothing more than checking a box that you’re capable.

If you really wanted to bolster your chances, pair some help desk experience with relevant cybersecurity certs, stuff like Security+ if you’re a beginning or CISSP if you really want to show your expertise (you can get an Associate of the CISSP if you lack the 5 years work experience - and I think an employer would value it just the same).

My next step is learning the control room side which I'm kinda scared of lol. There's a lot of responsibility placed on you for start ups and steam turbine merges.,2,1694658145.0,k0hwo7u
findapath,blue collar,comment,16hw6k0,,"There is actually a lot to learn for the job. I work at a combined cycle plant which uses both natural gas turbines/generators in conjunction with steam turbine/generators. So you learn about how the combustion and steam turbine operate, plus all of the equipment that supports their function. There's instrument air systems, hydraulic/lube/seal oil systems, the gas system, and depending on how the combustion turbines and HRSGs control for NOx emissions, ammonia systems. Also the plant I work at has equipment for making demineralized and de-ionized water and an old coal gasifier unit that is not currently in use, but may at some point down the road he retro fitted to be used.

Then you have the control room operator side of things, they are the individuals who are doing the the actual start ups of the combustion turbines, merging the units to the steam turbine, and taking units offline when called for. There is actually quite a lot you learn and get exposed to. It's a combination of classroom and field instruction with a healthy dose of self learning. You have to know how to bypass equipment and lines in the case of emergencies, know where the important valves are located, and how to maintain the equipment. Each of us has a trade background but we all do a bit of everything from mechanical, to instrumentation, to electrical tasks.

It's not a particularly easy field to to get into because you usually need operations experience or trade experience prior, and they typically want to find people with journeyman level experience to hire and train. Some plants do have their own apprenticeship programs though, so it's very dependent on the utility and plant itself. Also, you have to be okay with working rotating shift schedules, not many people are keen on it. It's not really something you get used to, you're usually always tired, especially the first day or two for a shift change, because you're working both day and night shifts, can be rough when you're working a lot too. This means you work holidays too because power generation is a 24/7 business. 

Overall we make it work, we cook out on holidays, have steak nights on night shifts, and when it's slow take naps, but I won't lie shift work is not for everyone. My recommendation for those interested in this type of work is to look for and apply to operator positions at power plants/utilities. See if they have an apprenticeship program or go do union apprenticeship in a trade like electrician, millwright, industrial maintenance, pipe fitter, or instrumentation technician to get the needed experience to test in. 

To get hired, I had to pass an electrical knowledge test, and hands on test to make sure I knew how to use test instruments, troubleshoot, and do it safely, and then an interview. What I've found from talking to people is that most people for whatever reason cannot pass these pre-hire tests, so it's important to have the needed knowledge for your tradecraft. I went through an IBEW apprenticeship and became a journeyman electrician, then applied to and hired on after I completed my apprenticeship and was a working journeyman.",3,1694721963.0,k0ll41x
findapath,blue collar,comment,16hw6k0,,"Sorry but we don't work a traditional 40 hour work week. I work what's called a modified DuPont scheduled so I work 36 and 48 hour work weeks that rotating from day and night shift. I work 430a-430p or 430p-430a. My 48 hour work week has 8 hours of built in overtime. However, we volunteer or get forced for overtime if it's needed. Overtime depends on what's going on in the plant. During periods where people are taking vacation or during plant outages, you're going to be working overtime, whether you volunteer or not. 

Some guys don't like to work overtime and end up with maybe a couple hundred hours by the end of the year. Some of us work 7-900 hours of overtime a year. It depends on whether you volunteer and how much you get forced in. That's just the way it is.

I make $47.40/hr. So if you do the math that's right at 100k with built in overtime, but I've already made 100k this year and I'm on track for about 150k this year. The guys who are topped out make $54/hr, and the ones who work a lot, make upwards of 180-200k for the year. Basically no matter how you slice it, where I work, you're going to make 100k as the very bottom, but more than likely 120kish a year and goes up from there depending on how much overtime you work and your pay rate.

I just got off my seven day break actually. My schedule rotates from 36 hrs then 48 hrs each pay period between day and night shifts. You do this every 28 days then get a full seven days off. Yeah swapping back and forth sucks, but I do get a lot of time off, plus PTO. I decided this year I didn't want to work a lot of overtime and that's how it's worked out. Now we do have a maintenance rotation, but with that I worked four, ten hour shifts, so Fri-Sun off every week for those periods. 

I've got it really good tbh, all of my tools, meters, FR clothing is provided by the employer. I hardly do shit for the most part to be completely honest. There isn't a ton to fix day to day as a plant electrician. It's all about making sure everything is working to produce power or be available to do so. So if everything is copacetic, then it's a boring job, and boring is good, because that means the power company is not losing money.

findapath,blue collar,comment,16hw6k0,,"A couple of different ways. You can try to get on somewhere as a mechanic helper that will basically give you an apprenticeship. You have to work around 1800 hours in the field to qualify to take your certification tests for airframe and powerplant through the FAA. Some places will straight up train you on site, some will pay for school. These jobs are hard to find. I am currently in school at a community college, taking night classes after work. My program is an associates degree that qualifies me to take the FAA tests after I complete the courses. It costs around $25k for the whole thing and is 2 years if you can go full time M-Th (8am-4pm), or a little over 3 to do night classes. I could do it cheaper by only taking the classes needed to qualify to take the tests, but I'm considering a bachelor's degree, so the associates is worth it to me. I'm almost 35 so I'd like the option to promote to a physically less demanding position later on, which is why I'm considering the bachelors program. Mechanics are in as high demand as pilots, so you can work just about anywhere in the world that has American built aircraft. You can make as little as $30 an hour working on small planes, or well over $200k working somewhere like GE On Wing where you travel internationally fixing planes, or you can work in a hanger somewhere like Southwest. Working for airlines will likely mean night shifts, but they start around $40, and cap you out at $70 hr at 5 years. They also do 9% 401k match there, which is not standard for the industry.  I am currently a machinist, and like that environment. I'm planning to work at GE as a mechanic for engines under development. The pay starts between $33-38 after 90 days, and you work 6:30-3pm with weekends and holidays off. You can also do a ton of jobs that don't require you to use tools, like technical writing and material testing. It's a really diverse field, and we are in high enough demand that you can basically interview companies you want to work for.

I've dug trenches, I've pulled cable, I've carried sticks of 4"" rigid that weighed nearly what I weigh, and all it does it wear your body out. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but my advice is to get into instrumentation as far as the electrical field goes. You carry a meter, a widget screw driver, and pen/sharpie lol. It's a very technical field, is mentally stimulating and interesting, and does not involve killing yourself. That's just me. Sometimes really hard work is just part of the job, and is fulfilling to a point, but once you start getting older, your body aches, it takes longer to recover, you're more prone to injury. 

The electrical field is diverse and you can do a lot with it. If bull work is more of your thing, try looking into being a millwright. They are industrial mechanics for large equipment like turbines, conveyor systems, mills, etc. Looks like interesting work tbh. If you can find your way into a power plant, that's the meal ticket.

So we have 12 weeks of built in time off plus your usual 3 or 4 days off a week, plus our PTO. 

They are pushing to do a 5th team for maintenance rotation and kick out the contractors. It's a big mistake. We don't have enough work to warrant a maintenance rotation, either lack of materials, poor planning on the planners part, lack of parts, etc. Not to mention we are so dependent on contractors, we really aren't trying to do more work than we already do lol.

I've (25M) worked as a software engineer for nearly 6 years now and have worked my way up to making $85k aa year, but due to a poor company experience after being acquired, laid off, then hired at another company again, I'm already feeling burnt out in this field. The projects I'm assigned work on now are alright, but I'm not really engaged and I just feel my soul being drained everyday; my passion for programming and making stuff on the PC just isn't there anymore after doing it as a job for a while.

A friend has recommended I come down and become a mechanic helper (with potential for advancement to a full mech ofc) in his field, and I'm totally up for it since it checks off quite a few desires like not sitting on my ass for 8 hours of screen time a day. Thing is, it's a total career change. My pay would probably be half of what it is now for a few years, would likely need to sell my car that I worked hard to buy for a cheaper one, and I'm simply scared of making such a huge change. I'm not in any terrible rush since I'm tied to my lease until it expires in the fall, but it's still a time limit. Should I act on this whim, take the leap, and give it a try? I'm getting conflicting advice from the people in my usual circle, so any advice from some internet fellows would be appreciated. Thanks!",13,1715558654.0,

I'm okay with putting in bullshit hours and doing bullshit work while I'm young, but the time my future kid is born, I'd like to have weekends and birthdays off, work 8 hour days (that begin at reasonable times), and not have to work overtime to make decent money. I have no desire for good, or even above-average cars or a good house. Good-enough (as in not broken-down, and somewhat presentable) is all I need when it comes to those things. 

The reason I'm even posting this at all is because I've been looking into welding, and I'm reading that most of the welders who make the good money are the guys who work overtime and travel a lot, and that's not something I want to be doing my ENTIRE career.

findapath,blue collar,post,1alfyb1,"A skilled, blue-collar job we don’t talk about much: baking","I’ve floundered around in retail and restaurants for about 10 years. This sub likes to recommend skilled, blue-collar work, and one that almost never gets brought up is baking. I work at a local industrial bakery (we supply bread/baked products for restaurants as far as 60 miles along with most of the local grocery stores and many restaurants, and we have our own storefront) and I love it, tbh.             
           
 It’s extremely physical so keeping one’s body healthy and in-shape even outside of the early and exhausting hours is very important (maybe moreso for me bc I’m prone to joint issues and muscular injuries), but I’ve literally never been in better shape and the early-on-early-off hours are actually amazing for maintaining a social life. Like going to bars late at night on weekdays may not be as much of a thing, but hikes, walks, dinners, visits to rivers or lakes or the beach, etc are so much more accessible than working 9-5 or even shittier hours at retail or restaurants.         
       
Also, as a generationally poor person, it’s cool as FUCK to get free/discounted fancy bread and pastries. My favorite jobs always give me access to things I can’t usually buy myself, and this is better than anything I’ve ever done lol. A free fresh loaf and unlimited day-old loaves and pastries??? I’ve had to control myself bc my family is prone to diabetes, but I’m seriously gifting bread to people constantly and they *love* it lol. “I formed this boule myself” gives me pride to say!          
         
So if you’re floundering looking for a trade, career, or just something to do for awhile, look at local bakeries for starting positions and express interest in learning baking.

findapath,blue collar,post,176axkm,Switch from blue collar?," Hello, seeking career advice. (posted in another thread as well, trying to cast a wide net)

TLDR: Should I switch my career path from journeyman electrician to go back to school for electrical engineering?

I am a green journeyman (Dec 2022) who recently was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis. I have been off work since the beginning of September this year trying to get a handle on this disease. I am hoping I will be able to get back on the tools at the end of this month but I still don't really know what this disease and my ability to work consistently will look like moving forward.

That said, I have been doing a lot of research into career options. I did really well in trade school (usually averaging above 90%) so have been strongly considering the Electrical Engineering Technologist program. Where I live (Canada) they have a two year program that will give you credit for 1/2 of one semester for already being a journeyman - so the program will only be 1.5 years - but it's still hella expensive. I guess I am just curious if anyone has done this and loved it, hated it, or literally any other experience. I have also considered estimating or something to do with BIM but my foreman told me he thinks that I would absolutely hate estimating because of how monotonous and thankless it is.

Also interested in hearing any one else's thoughts on alternative roles. I think something that is office based would probably make the most sense as I could probably arrange it so I could work from home if necessary. Again, I have no idea what this disease is going to present like moving forward. All I know right now is that it came on really fast and really brutal. Before I went on short term disability I was averaging 3 days of work a week and I am lucky my company likes me otherwise I probably would've been laid off. At the end of the day what I am most nervous about is the unpredictable nature of the disease combined with the unpredictable nature of the job (fluctuating hours, moving sites, booms and busts, etc.)

findapath,blue collar,post,1bvbi83,Would I be an idiot to pursue blue collar work with a college degree.,"A little bit of background, I have always been the middleman, peacemaker, and ""good kid"" of my family. So, when I went through high school and saw everyone was either gonna work in finance, law, healthcare, computer engineering or engineering in general; I really only considered those jobs and knew that going to university was a necessity (btw I hated being in class and university as a whole). My dad, an aeronautical quality manager who went to college, and my brother, a USC grad who works in finance, both pushed me to do one of those things and to go above and beyond. So, when I wanted to be an accountant, it wasn't enough and according to them I needed to be in finance. When I wanted to be a nurse, it was a ""stupid idea"" and that someone as ""smart"" as me should be a doctor. I always felt pressure and lost, I had no clue what to do because I felt the only options were those things. I end up going to USC with really still no clue what to do and now I work in marketing (never even considered this before until my senior year at SC) with little pay and about $60k left in loans. I hate working at a desk, on a computer, and I am silent-quitting at this point. My favorite job ever was being a barista at Starbucks and I loved the physical aspect of it (never shyed away from doing extra work and doing the harder tasks for others), the straight-forward tasks, working with a team and serving people, being able to have to critically think in what ways I can best support my team at that moment or how should I time things. Now, back to the present I am considering switching to blue collar work (I think just because the idea of working with a crew and being outside and doing physical work would be awesome) but its a huge shift and it kind of throws away the education I got at USC in business. My dad said its a stupid idea and not why I went to school. Now, there is an opportunity to be an apprentice electrician (I considered lineman or ironworker but I don't particularly like heights and electricians get paid pretty well) in my city (these programs don't always have space) and they get paid as much as I do right now just starting. The ability to get more pay as you go is great, the opportunities seem very promising and the job market looks good. Am I stupid to jump for this? What if my dad is right and I hate being an electrician as much as I hate this job right now. Should I just find the next marketing job, maybe in another niche field and hope I like it but I doubt the pay will be amazing either way? My dad and brother keep throwing it in my face that I should be making $90k a year by now. My therapist said maybe go to the sale side of my marketing field but even doing that I feel hesitant and for some reason this electrician opportunity just seems like my ticket to a great and happy career. At the end of the day I am an adult and I think what matters is I can pay my bills. Any advice here would be really appreciated, sorry for the long post!",6,1712196574.0,

Had no interest in aircraft but at the time thought it was a good option, finished the apprenticeship which was 4 years and did an additional year before deciding I just hated it.

I now work for a firm that deals in flood defence, manufacturing and installing lock gates all over the country, living in hotels most weeks and what I’ve noticed is that all blue collar jobs are the same in terms of atmosphere no matter where you go…

It’s just really depressing day to day listening to the moaning and groaning and the “banter” is just boring me. Feel like I’ve outgrown being around these types of people. I want normal, civilised chat - not talking about how so-and-so in the office is bad because of xyz.

IT Project Management: Project management roles often require both technical knowledge and strong communication skills. Your previous experience in engineering could translate well into project management roles within IT.  
  
Online Learning and Certifications: Consider taking online courses or certifications to bolster your IT skills. Many resources are available at no or low cost. Earning certifications can help you demonstrate your expertise to potential employers.  
  
Networking and Networking Events: Attend IT-related networking events or conferences to connect with professionals in the field. Networking can be instrumental in finding opportunities and learning from others who've made similar career transitions.  
  
Freelancing or Consulting: You might explore freelancing or consulting in IT. You can offer your services to individuals or small businesses, leveraging your IT expertise.  
  
Leverage Transferable Skills: Your previous roles have likely equipped you with valuable transferable skills such as problem-solving, attention to detail, and adaptability. Highlight these skills on your resume and during interviews.  
  
Career Counseling: Consider seeking guidance from a career counselor or coach who specializes in helping individuals transition into new careers. They can provide personalized advice and support. Lmk if you need help",1,1696343753.0,k3adwau

Then we go back and say “this look good?” 
Usually they say no, so we do it again,
Then when everything seems good, we set up the software as specified, hand off ownership to the client, then it’s on to the next gig.

findapath,blue collar,post,1cnnopl,Worth it to work a blue collar job for the possibility of being your own boss?,"So I’ve been in a life predicament that is really stumping me and I could use some advice. 

Following college, I worked for 2 years at 9-5 and quit to travel. Since then, I’ve been working seasonal positions to continue traveling in the shoulder seasons, however, I’m beginning to want more stability and financial freedom, as I live out of my car 6 months out of the year and barely make any money. This has lead me to consider all kinds of longer term career options but I just can’t land one. I think I’m coming to a crossroads and I could really use some advice.

Option 1: go to grad school (public policy), work that 9-5, pray for a remote position, mostly give up on traveling for weeks/ months at a time like I do now, and make a solid income.

Option 2: aggressively improve my upholstery skills (I currently have a job making $20/hr at an upholstery shop) in the hopes of running my own business one day. Build business, work hard, take time off whenever, travel. 

The truth is that I’m leaning towards upholstery but it’s so much scarier of a path. I don’t know if it’ll kill my body, if I have it in me to run my own business, or how much I’ll really earn. The autonomy, creative freedom, and lack of a boss is really appealing to me though. I hate dressing up, corporate culture, etc… I wish there was a desk job I could do where I can be my own boss but policy work doesn’t lead to that unfortunately.

But I have lost touch with my camera over the years and don't really see the journalism element playing out sadly to say, in a practical world. I write poetry and occasionally shoot film photography still. Part of me wants to really buckle down and take it seriously again. But then there's the practical side of me that is just like- ya right that aint gonna happen. I do thrive off creativity though. It's a big element of myself...I just don't see it practically being infused into the way I make my bread and butter though....

&#x200B;

Now I'm really lost on where to go. I considered doing online school and getting into forestry- I figured my hands on skills with heavy equipment operation, and the degree would work beautifully in tandem with land reclamation....Which is something I also feel passionate about as I'm an avid outdoorswoman from the mountain west

&#x200B;

Right now I work this insane schedule. It's called a super 7. It is 12 hour shifts and the cycle goes like so; 4 days, 7 off, 4 nights, 2.5 off, 3 days, 1 off, 3 nights 2.5 off. And repeat. The schedule is great if you can be diligent about going to sleep (Which I haven't been doing on my 2.5 off after my last 3 nights. And am heavily regretting it.) It allows you so much free time. But again- you have to be dedicated and responsible to getting sleep. I don't have kids, and I'm single as of now...no roommates, so I'm the perfect candidate for this lifestyle. But I was thinking this morning....Honestly this is a schedule that would make doing online schooling easier in many regards. I looked into OSU online and it has great reviews.....

&#x200B;

So right now I'm just lost on the direction I want to go next. There's so much I have interest in. On the one hand I do enjoy working in the trades. But for me it's more of a bucket list thing, than wanting to spend the rest of my career in it. Like every piece of equipment, or new skill I learn, it's like ""check, ok what's next."" And eventually I think I'm going to be ready to move on mentally (physically I'm already to move on because my hands and neck are on their way to crippled.)

&#x200B;

In a dream world I could work a job that I have an office and work at a computer occasionally, but work hands on with people and or animals a lot. I care a lot about women and children's livelihoods health and safety, but I also really care about preserving the mountain west and protecting our wild predators. I don't want to be in school forever, and I still want to have time to backpack in the summer....Thats the whole reason I took this job was because the schedule allows for it.

I have a small comment / piece of advice.  While many people think trades are underinvested (and they are) that sometimes doesn't translate to opportunity the way people think it does.   
 I've seen a couple of articles explaining how some labor markets have become ""thick"" which is something you might want to avoide.  E.g there is such a supply lack that employers don't want to train people because they employee will immediately jump ship once trained.  Basically, the old head's time has become too valuable to train new people.  


Depending on where you live and the specific trade this may not be an issue.  All I suggest is you call around to different businesses in your area and try and see if they are hiring fresh out of school.  You should probably be doing this anyway to figure out which trades are most in demand anyway.

findapath,trade school,comment,18mvm8y,,"I'll throw out an option in the trades that doesn't really involve manual labor - construction inspection. 

Anytime something gets built there are things that need to be inspected, usually by a third party, to make sure they follow the building codes or DOT specs or whatever it is. There are lots of quality assurance firms in construction that get contracted out to do this work. 

The work for the most part involves making sure things are being built according to the rules, i.e specs and codes, and also running certain tests on things like concrete, asphalt etc. You will do a good amount of walking around and some occasional lifting but nothing crazy. In fact there have been more than a few days that I got paid to sit around in the truck - that they pay for, including all gas and maintenance - playing my Steamdeck for four hours. 

You don't need to get any kind of degree for it at all, instead you have to get certifications to be able to run specific tests, and they vary by state (except for the ACI cert for concrete testing, which is good throughout the whole US and lots of other countries). These are usually completed in two or three days and most of these firms will sign you up for the classes and pay for them themselves. 

The starting pay isn't amazing but it's decent, and you can pretty quickly work your way up. For example I got hired on at $21/hr two years ago, now I'm at $26 and I have a friend at another company with six years under his belt making $43. The only issue I've had with the job is the amount of overtime. 50 hour weeks are frequent and  the most I ever did was 70. As a single 30 year old guy though I don't mind too much, the money adds up quick making time and a half. 

Already the market is desperate for inspectors because most of the inspectors around are old guys who are starting to retire in large numbers. The project I'm on now will be the last for half of our team. They're so desperate in fact that they're starting to hire people with no experience or certifications, like me. If you're interested in the field, what I would do is either: 

1)  drop some money on getting your ACI certification and then start applying to the firms, or 

2) apply to quality assurance positions at a concrete or asphalt plant. These jobs are honestly much harder than what I'm doing, but they have to run the same concrete and asphalt tests at the plant that we do in the field. Put in 6 months to a year and then start applying to the firms. A lot of guys have taken this route, and you'll likely get your certs paid for this way too.",2,1703098089.0,ke7ra8t

Right, but the problem is that none of them do, and that the physical stress of the job means “taking care of themselves” is more difficult than the average person.

findapath,trade school,comment,1d6phvo,,"My rec would be start working and making money. There is always time to study more, change careers later.  A sociology degree is fairly worthless unless you're doing higher education and don't want to start working for years.

The ""essential workers"" thing was a completely novel reaction in the history of mankind. Not sure if they will do something like that again in the future, but if you're looking for job security, consider the massive amounts of healthcare workers who have left the profession after that. According to the internet ""Seventeen percent of nurses quit their position within the first year of their careers—a whopping 56 percent left within the first five years. The average career length for nurses is now **nine years.""**

If you really want to do it then do it, just be prepared if it's more grueling than you expect. There are healthcare shortages and I know many nurses in a variety of fields. They change their jobs or working positions every few years and often complain about the management and frustrations of the job.  

It's very unlikely that you will experience something different. 

It sounds like you have a hard time making up your mind and sticking to finishing something if this is the second time you've dropped out of school. I would focus on finishing something and transitioning into a job ASAP. Then you can work and do RN training if that's still what you want to do. 

I also posted above, that you could volunteer cosmetology services to cancer patients, or other ill hospitalized people. There are ways to serve people and a community more than just your job. Try doing some volunteering or working in nursing homes. See what nurses do and deal with every day. Find some people you can shadow. Or try to find fulfillment in soup kitchens, homeless shelters, etc. 

There are tons of people who need help and if you feel strongly that is what you want to do, you could start that now. You don't need a job in that field to help people. People often burn out when their job comes from an idealized passion for something imo.",1,1717382057.0,l6uu5xc

It can be useful and it can introduce you to new avenues of thought and networking etc. I love learning.

I just see a lot of people languishing in school  to get a degree but not really being able to transition it into a job and winding up pretty lost later. Also, the debt problem is huge. 

When you're in your twenties it feels like you have to figure everything out all at once for the rest of your life. I'm a bit older than you and I'm starting to realize that many people change careers, and go in different directions, or have a more variable life/work path. It's part of what makes life exciting. You don't have to do it all immediately. Just keep working towards something you want and be willing to continue to do that as you grow older. 

Since you're in this sub you're obviously trying to find the right direction. Sometimes just getting out there and being able to work can help you focus on what you like/don't like to do, as well as supporting you, while you embark on learning or transitioning  into something new. 

I think I just worried about you because you sound very idealistic which is wonderful, but nursing can be a very hard profession. Sticking with something where you don't have much agency to make change and in a high stress situation can be very difficult and I think we need MORE people who are idealistic and hopeful and want to help. That's why I mentioned volunteering.

I never thought it would be this long after getting laid-off from a bad marketing job. 

I've done everything to try to find a job. 

At the point I've given up on my marketing career. My mental health isn't the best from this job market as I feel so battered.

1. Join the Active duty Air Force or Coast Guard. 

2. Join the Air National Guard (ANG) and do Welding program. 

I'm in my mid M30s so going Active duty military feels like I'm too old. 

The welding program is DoD funded for defense contractors. Even if I don't go active duty I want to get on Tricare via ANG.

findapath,trade school,comment,1cx66bh,,"A lot of people will tell you the military, but word of caution, you may end up in a worse position than before joining. At least, do not join the marines. 

My husband was in a similar spot before he joined (this was before we were even together). Wanted to fix up his life, get a job etc. he went in and did IT for 4 years. Could absolutely keep going the IT route, except it’s not something he actually enjoyed after doing it for 4 years. So if you pick something good, you still may not even enjoy it, and then at that point, you’re in a contract with the government and can’t break it, so you’re forced to go to work everyday until your contract is up.

The military also will strip you of any identity you have for a while. That’s kind of the point. To mold you into an obedient being. After you get out of the military, it will be very difficult to return to your “true self” and feel comfortable in civilian life. Please keep that in mind. 

My husband has been extremely depressed and upset that there’s really not much around to help veterans ease back into civilian life. It’s been about a year since he’s gotten out and still can’t get a job. He tells me everyday how regretful he is of joining and wishes he would’ve just went to trade school instead of wasting 4 years of his life with the military. 

The military could completely break you if you are not careful. Especially if you are strong willed and embrace your individuality. 

At least with a trade school, you still have your civilian freedom and a higher chance at making more money faster after you graduate from trade school.

Sure, you’ll get stability and pay in the military, but you’re going to have to sacrifice literally everything else in your life for that. You can always quit a job or trade program, but you can’t just quit the military once you’re in.",3,1716310944.0,l51n27x

As a non-rate, which is an E-2 to E-3 right after boot camp, expect to do a lot of grunge work, especially at small boat stations and on the big cutters. If you get stationed at a big support unit, the work is mostly cleaning and minor maintenance. For the first half of my term, I was stationed at a small boat station in Florida and we were working all day. There's the boatswain section and the mechanic (MK) section. I was on the boat section and our work consisted of non mechanical boat maintenance. So painting, redoing the grip tape on the decks of the boats, repairing lines, regular landscaping work, etc. The MK section is working inside the engine compartments, which I think sucks! I went to cook school after a few years of working as a non-rate and cook school is pretty sweet! Super laid back cooking good food all day, then you can eat it after. Then working as a cook at a unit is pretty sweet too. I didn't have to partake in any of the bullshit work, just cooked.

But also if you go for officer in either branch you also don’t get to pick your job you give your top choices and if you do well in school then you can get something good off of your list. But either way I still wouldn’t recommend guard or reserves to anyone who doesn’t have a career or job set up or is not actively planning to go to college right after. Because for one the benefits are only half and secondly if you’re already struggling financially the struggle continues after you finish training. You still have to go back to your home town and try to find work. Yea your pocket will be lined with a couple thousand from being on active duty status while in training and it helps, but there is still no guarantee of a job after, besides the small check you get from being part time. Whereas while in active duty your entire life is paid for , you get to travel cool places and there are other school credits that allow you to go to school while you’re in.

But a lot of people have also suggested trade school or an apprenticeship. That sounds pretty appealing, it would probably lead to a decent job way sooner and be more stable, plus no debt. But I am concerned about the work itself. I know it can take a physical toll and be pretty rough.

Plus my parents always wanted me to go to college, and I always figured I would. But I guess I'm a bit too old now to have a ""normal"" college experience anyway. I'm just worried I'll regret never going to college years down the line.

I don't think I would like a trade job, but I would make a ton more money than I am now. I could go back to college, but I don't know what I would study. I can't think of a single career that I would actually enjoy.

I doubt I would be able to move abroad without getting some type of skill and don't want to either. If went through trade school would I be able to eventually move abroad? I want to go to Spain, Germany, or some other European country. Maybe a different Spanish-speaking country because I'm learning Spanish, but it would probably be smarter to just move to New Mexico or Arizona instead.

I also don't know if I should even think about the trades. I sprained my neck 14 months ago at a warehouse job and it's still bothering me.

Once you've finished, examine the list and see if a your list might describe a job or career or maybe lead down a path that will point in that type of direction.

findapath,trade school,post,18su8p1,Can't decide between three option for trade school,"I decided to finally contact my local trade school/technical college. I ended up finding myself stuck between three to four options. My first two options are business and financial area that I have interest in. I always loved financial and business stuff since I was in high school. 

Finance and Banking Diploma seems like something I could do but I want something that's flexible and it's in my comfort zone career wise. Adding to Accounting certification to diploma as well. I already took Accounting in High school and could of gotten a certificate. The issue was my school didn't teach enough real world problems, what was taught from my school only about 10% of it was on the Accounting certification exam unfortunately. You can tell how that went and it felt frustrating. I'm a little worried going for Accounting diploma for that reason. 

Next two options is an area that I have no experience in. I don't know if computer stuff is for me. Cybersecurity certificate adding to IT certificate, which may not hold much because I heard it's all about experience mostly and what skills you offer for this career field. Part of me wants to try it out but I don't feel confident enough to do that. 

Last option is possibly Welding but as I said it's out of my comfort zone and something I have zero knowledge in. How should I go about this and what actually worth doing in my early 20s?",3,1703771093.0,

Highly recommend a trade. Personally I prefer wood so I'm a carpenter that focuses on decks and fences, dead simple work, but you can make decent money as an employee, or pretty damn good money as an entrepreneur. 


Photography is at risk from ai encroachment, and is much more heavily technical these days, sometimes to the degree of a graphic designer. 


Fine dining makes damn good money for the owners and chefs, but again, the biggest slice of the pie goes to the business owner. Unless you want to start your own high end restaurant you'll likely find the job market highly competitive, and a notable lack of security an an employee.

College is more expensive, and riskier.

Trade school is less expensive and risky.

College also is going to spend a lot of time trying to teach you how to think, be a good citizen, and other skills that don't directly translate to immediate economic value.

Short answer: college and trade school are for different things.  If making 60-90k is what you want, while working with your hands - trade school.  If you are willing to risk making 40-50k in order to have the potential for 250k+ and you don't want work with your hands, then college.",5,1717798207.0,l7lfg8l

They also hire students to pump those employment numbers. Many students just become professors lmao. Most students are better off just entering the trades after high school.

It’s not really their fault though — it’s like The Incredibles said: if everyone is special, no one is. Just supply and demand. There needs to be fewer and higher quality colleges that actually want to improve students’ lives instead of keeping budgets.

Another factor is colleges don’t really teach students useful behaviors or skills for real work. This is also because they’d rather lay low, avoid drama, and keep their students’ money since they’re not really rewarded for being tough.",18,1717791621.0,l7kxpdv

Degrees do open doors and make life easier while moving up in your given career path because every career path at some point requires a degree to move forward. Trade school is great for some people and pays well some trades man will make high 5 figures later in their career may low 6 but that is a smaller percentage of them than ones that don’t make those figures. Also those in trades that make more tend to own their own business etc. median plumber salary is 50-60 depending on state maybe a little higher electrician is similar.

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"Because the employment sector has changed a great deal since our parent’s generation. It’s no longer get a degree and get a job that is happy to train you appropriately. It’s get a degree and somehow you need 5 years of experience as a new grad and/or a masters degree for an entry level position. The requirements are quite frankly disproportional to the actual job tasks and that isn’t even considering low salaries that haven’t kept up with inflation. 

I will also mention that frequently the programs “required” for these positions are a lot of busy work and when you actually look at the job tasks then curriculum, you realize that not only could your time in school have been practically halved, but also that it is exorbitantly overpriced for the quality of education you are receiving. 

To summarize, our system has gone from lots of opportunities to spend your life slaving away in school and subsequently slaving away at a job that barely affords basic necessities. It’s hard NOT to feel lost when you’ve spent so much valuable time in a system and feel like you are either trapped or forced to spend even more time in school to switch career paths to something that likely doesn’t NEED someone with a full out degree. For example, in parts of the US, you don’t need a degree to be a phlebotomist but in Canada you need a medical lab technologist certification, which takes at minimum 2-years. It’s just that hospitals don’t want to appropriately train people so it shoehorns people into getting that education. 

People who have invested time and money in their careers expect return on that investment and are going to feel cheated or lost when they find themselves in a predicament. This especially when they come to find themselves unhappy with a career and retrospect that they had no time to explore other options due to said busy work and investments. People who don’t might feel stagnant in their positions, but it’s not like they spent all this time and money without being paid to get their experience.

One more thing… we rush people into choosing their life’s career at such a young age, then when someone realizes they made decisions that don’t suit their current goals, they have to deal with the ridiculous social pressure that comes along with it. If you do nothing, you keep miserable. If you decide to go back to school, you get unsolicited judgement of others who throw in your face about how you are OLD and should have a house and kids by now. You can be all in your late-20’s and people consider that “old” which is f***** up. Although this pressure was always a thing, I feel it is way worse now as people seem downright petrified to make changes into their 30’s. I NEVER thought 30 was old growing up being surrounded by successful adults because they made changes in their 30’s, but then started caving at all the social pressure of unrealistic standards for most people.",2,1717801573.0,l7lntmu

My dad was a doctor and as I had no interest in that so he encourage engineering. My mom was a teacher who before getting cancer was pursuing a PhD. All through college they held the line of get good grades and a good job will follow because companies will hire the top performers. For them it made sense. My dad's grades and MCAT scores got him into a good medical program. His top marks in med school got him into a competitive residency. And so forth.

For me graduating in the early 2000s my grades didn't mean shit. I'd gotten a CS degree from a state school that cared more about expanding than career services. I had zero idea about internships and coops so there I was applying for jobs with no actual experience and just my ""book learning"". I eventually got a job but it was a struggle. Many people I knew from school also struggled to find work because college didn't promote internships, teach networking, help you to build a network...The main people I knew who got a job had family connections or were in the engineering sciences programs where they'd spent their junior and senior year doing hands on projects in some cases for actual companies. There were some who got jobs through membership in clubs and orgs like NSBE but even some of those folks left unemployed. On the business side many people struggled to get jobs and I remember one guy who didn't get a single interview despite applying for investment banking jobs at every major bank with his 4.0 GPA. 

Thinking back my college had 1 career fair per year. Throughout my 4 years I only recall 2 instances where an internship was mentioned and the dean didn't say anything until the day before applications were due. It also wasn't until my senior year was almost over that I found out in the office they occasionally posted internship opportunities on a board. Many of the people I graduated with ended up pursuing a masters because they couldn't find work. FWIW the schools master's program fed into some local employers but not everyone can afford what at the time was an extra 2 years.

tl;dr Most people graduate from college with no practical worker experience or network of working professionals.

A trade skill will always be relevant and your services will always be needed.  Yes, the early part of your career will have shitty pay and you'll be the new boy or girl doing all the shitty jobs but you'll be judged more on your ability and work ethic than any corporate role and you'll end up getting out far more as you put in.

A 2020 report from the Higher Education Video Game Alliance (HEVGA) mentioned that over 500 institutions in the US offer programs in game design and development.  Every one of those institutions has say 30 people leaving with a game design degree. every year.  How many game studios are looking to recruit in the US and where are those 15k new developers going to end up.   Now look around your neighbourhood, how many of those houses need plumbing, heating or electrical work?",2,1717795216.0,l7l7vra

The trades have more than enough opportunity and if you ever need a *very specific* degree for a *very specific* career, college will always be there. Don’t listen to the idiots on here that majored in philosophy and expected 6 figures.

In fact, trade school would be *better* for you at this stage in your life because you can earn a lot of money while you’re maturing without going ungodly amounts of debt. Then, if you decide to go to college at 25, because you’re mature and you know *exactly* which path you want to choose, you’d be far better off.

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"My viewpoint: 

Too many, including myself, were sold this bill of goods that you just get a college degree and it's your ticket into a better life. 

I'm a 50-year-old generation X, and I remember all of us feeling that if my older brother and I just get college degrees, will be able to get good full-time jobs that pay well and be able to do well in our lives. Instead, we were shown that we need the degree in order to get past HR and get an interview, but 9 out of 10 times, everything we learned means nothing. That you learn the entire line of work on the job...and more often than not. Nobody wants to teach you. 

I still feel like the youth are sold that bill of goods even now. 

I also feel like too many have been told to follow their dreams or do what interests them, and yet they end up going after majors and programs and things that don't have a real end goal. I see too many times where the person complaining on social media that they can't even get an interview finally shows their degrees and they are in majors that don't seem to make much sense in the modern world.  More often than not, I want to just reach through the screen and ask them what their grand plan was for the area of study they went into. 

It always comes off to me that too much of the youth are afraid of taking on complicated topics that require a lot of work and a lot of study and a lot of discipline, but when you get that degree it is in a place where companies are going to be courting you to come work for them. 

I even see this with people that either skip college or got a bachelor's and then they run off to some boot camp or training academy to learn basic skills in something technical. They have this attitude that they just want to learn this, get their certification, shut their brains off, and do the same job forever and get paid well. 

I feel like we need to really start pressing on the youth that there is no such thing as a good paying job in this world where you can just shut your brain off and do the same thing forever. That if you are not going to learn new things and hone your skills, even if you do a vocational trade, then you're going to fail in life. 

Lastly, I also keep hearing these stories of students that ran off to another state to live in a dorm and go to school and now they are complaining that they have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. My heart goes out to the people that don't have access to a local community college or a university in their neck of the woods, but too many people do. I can understand if you want to go to another state because it's some specialized school that's going to teach you something amazing that will give you high paying jobs in life, but if you're in that hole, ""I need to explore the world"" ideology and decide to take on all that debt, then you can't complain about it later.",2,1717800572.0,l7llc6h

It doesn't help that many kids from the age of around 13 to 18 are raised as if their only or main goal is ""go to college"" or ""get into a good college,"" and then of course, they do and discover that they still have their whole lives in front of them, but nobody really gave them much guidance on what comes after.

And it also doesn't help that college has become the default option in our society, so if you're already feeling ""lost"" at 18, the overwhelming advice your going to get from Authority Figures is ""go to college.""

There is a this concept that finishing school is the end of a marathon. And that the degree is the highest achievement of your life. Where as the truth is this is the beginning of your career. One of the many building block you need to build up your career. Which for white collar career, the peak of you earning ability doesn’t come for most people until at least a decade into your career. 

This is a long timeline for someone that is 23 and fresh out of school. White collar tend to start out on the lower end, peak 10-15 years before retirement. And this latter decade for some folks can bring in more than the entire working career of some tradesmen. 

Trades on the other hand start out higher but you peak earlier. Despite what people tell you. The amount of white collar that can clear 300k+ at any point in their career far outweighs the tradesmen that can do the same. As a tradesmen you are almost always limited by the same 24 hours god gave all of us but physically ability tend to dwindle with age. But intellect goes up with age 

This is something I learn after decades in the work force. I too drop out of school to pursue a trade and have done very well for myself, manage to pivot into management but next step up to executive, I will be face with competitors with degrees (multiple sometimes) and years of experience managing the direct core of various business.

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"I can only speak from my experience. 

My goals really shifted. I switched to a Finance degree while in college for more than one reason. One of my primary reasons was that I already had a full time job working in retail banking. My goal was to graduate and move up the ladder to a financial advisor, or to a branch manager. Right after I graduated banks began shutting down tons of bank branches and I wasn’t anywhere near a corporate location. Retail banking also didn’t pay very well and it was becoming increasingly stressful—I didn’t feel like it was worth the low pay to be that stressed out. 

An additional reason why I switched to a finance degree was that it was a broad degree. I understood the fundamentals of accounting, management, marketing, and, of course, financial analysis. I felt the degree had a good foundation for long-term success in an ever changing labor market. Some of that has proven to be true. I’ve worked in a few different areas.

Besides retail banking and financial sales, I’ve managed inventory systems for warehouses, acted as an account manager and logistics coordinator for a plastic manufacturer, and now I’m a project manager for an industrial construction company. I’ve been able to work in a few different industries and the foundation I had from my finance degree really helped me transition well. The only thing it didn’t do was help me find the place I feel most at home. 

I’ve been feeling lost for years because I realized I went to college for something that didn’t really align with my core values. I wish I would have gone to school for something like psychology, or political science. I would love nothing more than to be a professor of Social Psychology or Political Science.

Don't just listen to someone when they tell you you should do something. Think about your life, what your interests are. If you are unsure, there's nothing wrong with working an entry level job for a little bit while you take some time to decide.

If you have a plan, which you seem to, and that plan is rooted in reality, it makes way more sense to go with it than it does to arbitrarily get a degree that everyone says you should get. For instance, right now blue collar is doing really well. Trades are not a bad option at all. Let's say you become an electrician or a plumber and work for 5 years.

I have a business degree. You can make good money, but I don’t enjoy the mental stresses. I prefer to work with as little people as possible and have a strong disregard for authority. Most corporate environments simply aren’t my cup of tea. 

I’ve learned 100x more working for businesses than I ever learned in undergrad business schools. Sure, you learn all the jargon, how to do research, how to put together presentations and plans. All things you can learn on the spot from a few videos if ever necessary. 

Experience is the best teacher and quite frankly, I would have rather been paid to learn and experience as one does starting as an apprentice in a trade rather than fuck around in class and pick up terrible sleep, drinking and smoking habits while doing the bare minimum to get a piece of paper that 7 years working out of college lands me an interview with 1/100 places I apply for despite working for some well-known companies in decent positions.

With all that being said, college is very good for the connections and lifelong friends you’ll make which may very well get your foot in the door for some great career opportunities.

I dated a self made multimillionaire who was a successful real estate developer in Los Angeles. I knew nothing about real estate before meeting him, but after splitting 6 years later, I gained the experience, knowledge, and skills  that a business owner with their masters degree won’t ever deal with. I got my foot in the door as a refinance escrow assistant where I learned how to process refinances in 47/50 states. When I got laid off, I got another escrow assistant job but for NATC, who exclusively handled Opendoor property transactions. Long story short, in 9 months total, I managed to become someone who could close an all cash transaction same day. All docs signed and recorded, AND have funds disbursed. I was on a team of 6 and I only was responsible for doing title commitment markups….but the strong survive and It was me and an associate who kept a dying ship afloat after everyone got kicked off or jumped off. Real life experience with solving every file with different stressful situations, along with knowing the Opendoor account like the back of my hand, I applied to Opendoor directly for an escrow officer position. You bet your ass everyone doubted my abilities because no one lands that kind of position without 5+ years under their belt. I did with not even a year under mine. I can run a business in my damn sleep and if there’s not a loop hole I don’t already know, I can’t wait to find one.

Jobs and upskilling are something you have to commit to every day. There is absolutely nothing wrong with ""job hopping"" as long as it aligns with your goals and expertise. Opportunities don't pop up every day and employers who see that negatively or give a rocky answer can be detrimental to people. Nothing wrong with writing a professional thank you letter to your direct manager, and asking for their blessing if the stars align in the future to meet your personal and financial goals.

So I went to college, I loved it, and I use my computer science degree in my software engineering job. I don't regret this at all. College was worth it for me but the balance of people going to college today is way off. 

We have spent four decades in the US telling parents that they are a failure if their child doesn't go to a four year college. This is so very wrong. College isn't for everyone and that's not a bad thing. Ballroom dancing isn't for everyone. I don't do it. I don't feel bad about it either.

The end result is that we have a huge gap in the trades. We also have too many college degrees. So folks with college degrees can't find work in their field or can't find good enough work to justify their debt. And trades people are so in demand you can't get them to return your phone calls unless your brother in law knows them personally.

Back up 35 years. Lots of local and regional industries are booming. It's a relatively safe option to graduate with a degree in what-the-fuck-ever and apply to a corporation local to you. My parents were in Michigan, so for them, auto companies were hiring, and a degree meant that you were able to skip the blue collar bullshit. You could get a desk job doing finance or you could help run a plant. Money was phenomenal. Student loans were a wash. 

Fast forward to a decade ago. The same industries are awash with college grads, who all lack any real skills. The same thing was true back then, but higher education was a hot commodity. Those people knew how to read well, write well, and were generally teachable. Today, that's expected as a baseline. 

For better or worse, education doesn't make you employable unless that education is relevant to the task at hand. Add in the cost of education, relative to its benefits, and we have a disconnect. The entire role of HR or hiring is to find the *best* candidate. This means education, experience, and aptitude. If a potential hire has none of those attributes, the hiring process stops.

A degree, in a vacuum, does not help anyone. It never did. It's more accurate to say that the same degree was the mark of a better potential employee back then.

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"Lemme talk about another perspective, from employers:

High skill job employers want you to have experience. College graduates are useless with just their textbook experience. You know how people complain, why learn manual math over using a calculator? Employers think that too, they don’t need someone to recite textbook knowledge they can look up. The employers can train you, but high skill jobs are harder to train.

Low skill job employers also need to train employees but it is easier. They are fine with training you. However, they consider what happens afterwards. People with college degrees go for a low paying job usually for temporary sustenance. If the employer trains you for 3 months and you go for another job in 5 months, why would they train you? 

When you go for the low skill jobs, sometimes it is important to not boast all of your academic accomplishments. When mentioning a good college name, couple it with something else like why it’s not realistic to pursue your dream job anymore, even if it’s a lie.

Some people complain about employers trying to keep the employees locked in poverty, but it’s less of them actively doing it and moreso them looking for people already stuck. Play around that.

Not to mention, the connections you make in college can also be very valuable, you are working with others who are (hopefully) driven and ambitious and will take their career seriously. Your colleagues will help you in the future as well.

Unfortunately, people focus only on the expected starting salary out of school, and don't consider the probability of getting a job, when deciding how much to borrow. Psychology, for example, is one of the worst bachelor's degrees to get because there is so much competition. You have something like a 50% chance of actually finding work in your field with that degree. 

The starting salary for a psych degree is like 45k, meaning you shouldn't borrow more than 20-25k for the degree in total when you factor in the 50% chance of being employed in the field. How do you do that? Community college, grants, scholarships, saving in high school, living with parents and not in dorm, etc. 

People borrow too much for their degrees and get themselves into trouble later on. College is a bad investment if you don't factor in risk properly.

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"Honestly college and graduate school, in my experience, do terrible at prepping you for practical job experiences because they largely focus on theoretical vs applied knowledge. I’m working on a Masters and realizing certifications would probably help advance my career, but they’re not integrated into my graduate curriculum at all and would be a side cost/side labor. I know my parents dissuaded me from working during high school to “focus on my grades”, and as an IB student, more “practical” school electives were offered-limits. A lot of students don’t even get a job during college. 

Also, a lot of our parents heard that going to college would guarantee a high paying job so didn’t really bother on equipping us with any employable skills or even job seeking knowledge because they assumed college would. Now, several degree fields are oversaturated and several career fields value worked experience more than education.

I also think academia is largely a)set up for people with financially privileged backgrounds that can forgo “normal people” jobs b)set up with the assumption most people will stay in academia rather than try to work outside of it",1,1717852757.0,l7o7iwj
findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"Some careers legitimately require a technical-focused degree - structural and civil engineering, architecture, nursing, law, and similar. You must have the required degree(s) from an accredited college before you can get the related professional license, along with some years of related experience.

You don't really need a business degree to do any career in particular, with the possible exception that some Wall Street firms hire only from the Ivy League schools. 

I'm a (retired) architect so I had to have a specific undergraduate degree. At the time, it was allowed to skip the masters degree and make up for it with work experience in the field, so I did that. During an economic downturn, I got my MBA. The MBA looked good on my resume because it was unusual at the time, but now it's not so rare anymore.

Unless you really, really need a specific technical degree, but also want a degree of some kind, I would attend classes at a local community college for all the basics - english, maths, history, and etcetera. Be sure those credits can transfer, then finish the degree at a state college. That gets you into their alumni system, which has helped me at times.

So what happens next? Well no kid wants to work at Burgerking long term so he goes to college. IF, IF he choses one of the golden majors like Engineering, Accounting, anything medical (nursing, allied health)  supply chain management , computer science etc... then he/she will most likely be fine. The transition from college to ""adult job"" is easily there ASSUMING you go for one of the golden majors (nursing, accounting etc...).

Ah but what of the folks who are not interested in computer science, engineering, nursing etc... the ""golden majors"", what of the folks who are interested in history, english, pysch, social work etc... Well for those folks more than likely at least at the start of their career they are probably going to end up in jobs not related to their degree at all.  So the English grad, the history grad working a call center job, data entry job, customer service job etc... Now what a tick what does data entry work have to do with graduating with a degree in English? And maybe it is just me but working a call center job after a pysch degree kind of seems like a waste of a degree... And that is where the feeling of ""lost"" comes from. All the folks working some job completely unrelated to their degree, how is hard not to feel lost, to feel like you wasted so much time and money? And I do think it is safe to assume that the English grad does not want to work the call center job anymore than the nursing grad.

And the whole ""follow your dreams thing""... welp if your dreams are one of the ""golden majors"" you should be good. But pity on you if your dream is something like History, sociology, English etc... and god forbid your dreams is anything creative like environment artist, character artist, UI/UX designer, video editor etc... 

  
Overall it's like a whole generation was told ""if you want a good paying job, then you have to go to school and graduate"", only to find out that the ""good paying job part"" largely only applies if you majored in the ""RIGHT"" degree- nursing, computer science, accounting etc... and ""best of luck everyone else"" I guess.

I highly disagree, and I think a good, solid plan to get to your goal is SO much better. Many people just take loans because they want that degree fast (and as you see, the degree itself doesn't matter as much as not being broke), so my opinion is that your 20's should involve getting a degree, but also planning for your future life.

Here's an honest plan, that could work, but it requires eating a bit of shit pie to get where they promised you:

Work in some job that pays decently enough to get you through college, these will be manufacturing, truck driving, or some other type of labor job. Depending on your location you should be getting $18-$25/hour. Work that job for a year or two before going into university, save everything you can. Keep working there all the way through school.

  
Go to community college and get your general education done.  
Choose a school that is relatively inexpensive. $20,000 for a degree is what I'm referring to.

Don't get married, have a kid, or buy a house, or a new car while doing any of this. If you can live with your parents without paying rent, that's the best option. Otherwise, find a roommate and move into some apartment or something and only pay $300/month max.

Don't eat out, don't buy a new phone, no major life changes or purchases.

Once you've exhausted all of this, and you're sure you can't squeeze more money from somewhere (employers who pay tuition for example, or a relative offering to pay a percentage maybe), then take a loan for the remainder of your education.",1,1717855789.0,l7oehkc

findapath,trade school,comment,1daju2s,,"The rest of the plan.

Now move to the Business courses.  There are 6 or 7.  Take Introduction to Business, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Business Ethics, Financial Accounting, Business Law and if you can Calculus.  Try this after College Algebra but if you get bogged down skip it.

Now take these Business Electives.  Principles of Management, Principles of Finance, Managerial Accounting, Statistics, Public Speaking and Developing Effective Teams.  If you have time on the Sophia subscription take Critical Thinking as well.

So where does that leave you.  If you do the first 15 courses you have complete UMPI's General Education Curriculum of 40 credits and 1 free electives.  Total credits 41.  Workplace Communications does double duty as  3/36 credits BBA credits.

The second set of courses give you 18 more credits.  UMPI has a combined Macroeconomics and Microeconomics 3 credit course and they make you take both to get credit for that 3 credit course.  They just give you 3 free elective credits as well.  So the breakdown of the 18 credits is 12 BBA credits, 3 Accounting concentration credits and 3 credits of free electives for a total of 59 credits.  You now have the 40 GEC, 4 free elective credits, 15 BBA credits and 3 Accounting Concentration credits.

The Business electives gives you 16 more credits of free electives getting you to 40 GEC, 20 free elective, 15 BBA and 3 Accounting credits and a total of 75 credits as the 3 Workplace Communications course is counted in both the 40 GEC and 15 BBA.  If you do Calculus skip Public Speaking and Developing Effective Teams.  The counts will be 40 GEC, 16 free elective credits, 19/37 BBA credits and 3/24 Accounting credits.

Time period for the above plan is 2-5 months.

Now go to Study.com.  Use the JoshMadakor promocode to get 30% off for 3 months.  There are only 5 courses and 15 credits.  Take Bus303, Acct 301, 201, 202 and 302.  That adds 6 BBA credits and 9 Accounting concentration credits.  You are now at 40 GEC, 20 free elective (16 with Calculus), 21/36 (or 25/37 with Calculus) and 12/24 Accounting concentration credits and 90 total credits.  Time period 1-2 months for $375-$400.  There you have it.  75% of a degree at UMPI in 3-7 months for $554 to $779.

The last 10 courses at UMPI consist of 12 Accounting Major credits and 15 BBA credits.  If you did not take Calculus then 3 of the 15 credits will be the Business Math course.  Those 9 courses will be worth 27 credits and you will need to take a free elective course at UMPI as well.  If you did do Calculus at Sophia that will be two free elective courses.

UMPI has 6 eight week terms throughout the year costing $1500 per term.  Regular pace is 2 courses per term.  10 courses would be 5 terms or $7500.

For those just needing a degree, Management or the Bachelor in Liberal Studies with a minor in Management or Accounting would be cheaper.  No Study.com.  Just do the first two sets of courses for your 59 credits and then take 10 more courses and Developing Effective Teams for 31 credits all at Sophia.  Then pick a minor.

All of the above was to show that you could get a degree for less than $10k from a regionally accredited university with a brick and mortar campus and a degree that looks identical to the same degree you would get if you went on campus.

WGU is another school like UMPI but about 10% cheaper.  6 month terms for a little less than $4k a term.",1,1717806779.0,l7m0995

There's a reason the average income for a person with a bachelor's degree is 65k while for a person with a HS diploma it's 35k. An overwhelming majority of higher-paying job offers, even at small businesses, request, as a foot-in-the-door step, to have a relevant (or sometimes any) college degree.

I just looked it up, and only 7% of jobs in my area that pay 60k in any part of the possible range are open to people who do not have any college degree. And of those listed, I saw only one where the 60k was at the low end of the listed range.

Getting a college degree is not for everyone, but it's also important when making the decision away from getting one, when you have the reasonable option of getting one like OP does, what the reality is. 

Doing what you say and marketing your skills independently (assuming you mean marketing your skills as a small business / contractor) has a very high failure rate, higher than the failure rate of attaining a college degree.

There was one time we interviewed two candidates; neither with any experience. We chose the high school graduate over the college grad because the better candidate could answer our questions and demonstrate competence on the whiteboard during the interview.

The high school grad had been staying busy, reading and practicing on his own at home how to code whereas the college grad was apparently just doing their class homework. The younger one manufactured hands-on experience for himself whereas the other still only had abstract academic exercises.

My advice is based. If you can show the interviewer you can help contribute to the real world work, that's always who the employer is looking for.

5 years is approximately how long it takes for one to get a grip on their industry and learn the in and out that is never taught in school. It’s also the approximate time it take for trades men to finish their apprenticeship and start making real money. 

If you applied yourself and keep taking in new skill. This is just about the time where you would be able to use both your experience and your degree for better/higher position. 

The reason why most people think degree aint useful is because a lot of people have the concept that you finish school, that it and you get to cruise. Which is as far from the truth as it is. Getting a degree is just the beginning. How you use it is for the next several decade is really what matter. 

White collar degree tend to have their earning peak at the later decade of their career. For some people this can be 10-20x their initial pay. But this require the hustle, constantly upgrading yourself. 

For trade, their pay grade tend to peak at the peak of their physical ability and it either stagnant or dwindle near the end of the career if they can’t manage to pivot into management or start their own business.

findapath,skilled trade,post,18j5fnu,How can I find the perfect skilled trade for me?,"Hello, everyone. I'm gonna make this post as quick but detailed as possible. 

So yeah, I'm a 20 year old tall, skinny kid in the city of Toronto who has to make a big decision soon and I need some help.

To start, I'm not that smart. I always had learning difficulties throughout my academic career due to my MID (Mild Intellectual Disability). I had to dropout of college recently due to a combination not having genuine interest in my program, not working hard enough and struggling to keep up with learning and that resulted in me failing as a college student.

 I only went to college to study cybersecurity for the money, I heard it was an in-demand, lucrative career where one can work **almost** anywhere, if not anywhere in the world. And you have an opportunity to work from home in this field, it sounded convenient so I tried it out and it wasn't for me.

I don't regret going to college though, even though it wasn't enjoyable. But I do have to find a job that doesn't make me constantly miserable, have some potential to be competent at, that doesn't make me feel retarded, gives me enough time to do hobbies, and gives me enough money to not worry about paying bills or food or entertainment. And potentially giving me a good salary as years progress too. 

That is my dream life as a civilian, an honest living with a nice work-life balance where I don't struggle financially in everyday life.

Problem for me is that I don't even know which trade is the best for me. Electricians make good money but I don't want to work a job involving heights. I'm scared I might fall and get injured or die. Or get zapped by an electric wire.

I heard that plumbing is another lucrative route but, it's an on-call job. What if I spend years studying the plumbing trade and I don't get enough work calls to successfully make a living? That's **brutal.**

I tried contacting a trades organization but they only take in high school students, I'm a 20 year old college dropout so.... yeah. I'm gonna have to ""figure it out"" since I'm an ""adult"".

I've thought about working for a carpentry union but I wanna know all my options before I commit to a trade, I don't wanna miss a good opportunity and feel regretful in the future.

Does anyone have any ideas? How can I find the perfect trade for me based on these variables mentioned?

Trades, you are selling your services to somebody but you can control your skills and the final outcome.

Sales, you are selling a product that you most likely have no control over. Higher possible upside for income but you also have less control over your success.",1,1710778420.0,kvfzz9v
findapath,skilled trade,post,1d84t45,"25 with no degree — stick with my 55k/year job and do online classes, Join a skilled trade, or go into sales? ","I just got promoted to 55k as a parts advisor at a dealership, pretty low stress 8-4 style job where I'm home every night -- so I have time to pursue some courses/classes at university. 

My current job does have decent promotions and raises, the top guys who aren't managing make about $75k. 

However, I don't feel as though parts is a career you can eventually do on your own as a small business or learn a valuable skill like electrical/plumbing etc. 

I got offered 2 other jobs as well..

1. Sales for an HVAC company. Demanding job that requires I manage in office staff and field installers, while doing outside sales. 60k/year base salary + commissions (roughly 80-100k/year) working 40-60 hours a week. Need to be available at 8pm on a weekday or any given Saturday/Sunday as it depends on when the clients want to meet. They expect in 3-5 years it would be about $120-$140k/year. 

2. Electrician for an industrial company. 1st year apprentice and would make $20/h with decent amounts of OT. Usually 7-3 schedule. Eventually pays around $40/h+ as journeyman, and provides the option to move into an estimator/project manager position or to open a small business. Can also take online classes once I'm established and maybe move into instructing at a university. 

Any advice?

I have zero sales experience, and have worked a few construction jobs but nothing skilled labour. ",4,1717526912.0,

findapath,skilled trade,comment,1d84t45,,"What important to you?

Are you trying to save and invest so you have more options in the future/retire early? Or do you care more about lifestyle and chillin?

If you prefer the money go sales route. If you are a successful salesperson you'll never be out of work. Companies are always looking for talented sales people, and if you get into tech sales the commissions are ridiculous. HOWEVER, sales is highly dependent on the economy AND its a lot of work. I wouldn't do this if you don't have any experience. 

There's going to be a downturn in the economy that starts noticeably in the next 6-12 months (probably), so you might actually want to pick something that is moderately immune to economic downturns. Sales is definitely not the place to be during that time. Idk about car parts.  Could always wait for the economy to recover before going into sales. 

2nd option as an electrician sounds pretty good from a stability perspective (tho idk specifically). Money seems good, along with career potential, so its a question of keep your chill job/lifestyle, or make more money. Kinda sounds like you wanna make more money, so I would say do the electrical.",3,1717528218.0,l73vgel
findapath,skilled trade,comment,1d84t45,,"Well while you are making up your look at your local CC.  See how many Cleps they take.  Look at a local state university.  See which ones they take.  Now check out Modernstates.org.  I would take these in roughly this order.  College Composition with Essay, Analyzing and Interpreting Literature, US History 1, American Government, if you live in Texas US History 2, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Psychology, Sociology, Biology and College Algebra or best yet Calculus.  If you are bi lingual Spanish or whatever language you took in HS.  Use Khan Academy AP courses to supplement modernstates.org material.

Or you could take a Promocode from r/sophialearning and do these courses.

Student Success, English 1, English 2, Workplace Communication, Introduction to Ethics, Introduction to Sociology, Art History 1, Visual Communication, Introduction to Statistics or College Algebra or best Calculus 1, Human Biology, Human Biology with Lab, Environmental Science, US History 1, US Government and Spanish 1.

If you do the CLEPs above except for the Math, Science and Spanish just do Student Success, Workplace Communications, Introduction to Ethics, Visual Communications, College Algebra, Human Biology, Human Biology Lab, Environmental Science and Spanish 1.  

Either way you end up with the 40 General Education Curriculum completed and 1 free elective credit.  You also have 3/36 credits of the BBA requirements.

Now you take Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Introduction to Business, Business Ethics, Business Law, Financial Accounting.  That gives you 12 more BBA credits bringing you up to 15/36 and 3/24 Accounting Concentration credits plus 3 more free elective credits and a total of 59/120 total credits.  Give Calculus 1 a shot after  College Algebra.  If you can get through that you will be at 63 credits.  You will have 4 more BBA credits bringing you up to 19/37.  

Now take these Business electives, Principles of Management, Managerial Accounting, Principles of Finance, Introduction to Statistics, Critical Thinking and if you did not do Calculus take Developing Effective Teams.  If you did take Calculus, skip Developing Effective Teams and Critical Thinking.  Do Critical Thinking if you have time left on your subscription.

Either way you will end up with 75/120 credits for the YourPace BBA in Accounting.  If you want a moderate pace the above can be done in 5 months with one $80 Promocode and one $299 for month subscription.  If in the likely event you have time left on your 4 month part do as many of the following courses as you can.  Do Critical Thinking,  all of the IT courses, Project Management, Personal Finance and Introduction to Nutrition.  

Your next stop is Study.com.  Using the JoshMadakor Promocode you get 30% off for 3 months.  You would take Bus303, Acct301, 201, 202, and 302.   This will bring your total credits to 90 broken down this way.  2 months and the additional proctor fee would be $400.

Non Calculus version.  40 GEC, 20 free Electives, 21/36 BBA credits and 12/24 Accounting concentration credits and 90 total credits for the degree as the 3 Workplace Communication credits are included in the GEC and BBA.  How long the last 10 courses take you at UMPI is up to you but the normal pace is 2 classes per 8 week term.  5 terms at $1500 flat would be $7500.",1,1717585608.0,l7792ml

Skilled Trades:

Pros - Stable, Pays Decent (J-man wage of $40/h = $70-$80k without OT), Can own your own business or do side work at a minimum, Hard Skill that's recession proof, Lots of paid OT, usually off at 3pm, Clock in and clock out and don't have to worry about customers emails/appointments at 7pm or weekends 

Cons - Physically exhausting, dirty/hot/cold/unsafe work environments, co-workers can be abrasive, can be required to travel for weeks at a time

Sales: 

Pros - Can pay very good (not uncommon to make $70-80k your first year), flexible schedule as you advance, can work remotely, usually in an office/home out of the elements, work hard and get rewarded

Cons - Not a hard skill that can make you $ in a recession, unstable, stressful high-turnover career, can kill it one year and be laid off the next, have to be ""on"" all the time, can have appointments in the evening/on weekends after working all day/week ",1,1718132411.0,

findapath,skilled trade,comment,18q0ci3,,"Whoa, the amount of misinformation in this thread is shocking. I'm not a Registered Nurse, however, I am familiar. It is absolutely not like ""going into the trades"" whatsoever. I'd imagine someone going into the trades doesn't want anything too academically rigorous nor do they want to spend too much time in school. Becoming an RN requires a 4-year bachelor's degree at university. Admission into these programs is competitive and require the same courses in high school as a person applying to Bachelor of Science programs in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Physiology, or any other natural/life science degree. This is not what you're looking for OP.

In addition, OP said ""I’m not good at the stereotypical female skills of dealing with peoples emotions"". Being an RN very very heavily involves these skills. Even RNs who love working with people can get burned out from this aspect of nursing. The only exceptions are specialities like operating room nursing or nurse anesthesia. The latter requires a 4-year bachelor's degree in nursing plus a doctoral degree i.e., Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). That would be at least 7 years of university education.

The stereotypical ""female equivalent"" of going into the trades are the following: cosmetology, aesthetics, **interior decorating**, event planning, **culinary arts**, etc. The healthcare equivalents are: dental hygiene, massage therapy, veterinary tech, **medical lab tech,** personal support work, practical nursing, etc.

\^The ones that don't involve dealing with people's emotions as much are highlighted for you above.

Whoever told you it was easy to move up in a union job is flat out wrong. Union jobs are time in role, nothing else. You can be the best or worst, but if you’ve got seniority you get promoted. Getting promoted isn’t always good either. 
Be aware that to make a lot of money you’ll also have to put in a lot of time. These jobs are ok on the hourly, but generally have more hours than employees, so lots of OT and 6 day work weeks.

Get into a trade you’re interested in and start your own business. You’ll probably need to train in a workplace that is mostly men, but that’s what it is. Handyman for example, make $100/hr and have basically unlimited work. In my state they don’t even need s license under a certain job size. Landscaping or farming is another. A lot of small time plumbers work solo. There’s a huge company that inspects and treats telephone poles. They work solo and hey paid fairly well. Boring though.

The main thing is choose something that you can stand doing, because you’ll be doing a lot of it. A lot of these jobs are just time consuming.

Alternatively what about sales? I employ a bunch of sales people, the most successful ones are making like 200k. Middle of the pack are making 50-80k and Unsuccessful ones making 40-50k before washing out.

I suppose you could try to get scholarships for nursing school or some other healthcare related job. Some states will pay you to get a CompTIA certification (IT). The military will pay for schooling.

Another option would be to work for a company who will pay for your degrees and certifications, but you usually have to work for them for so many years after that, and you’re typically restricted in what schools they’ll pay for.

I’m doing my LHR (laser hair removal) technician training in ATX which only requires a GED or HS diploma to start and no aesthetician license; laser tattoo removal training is the same as well.

I paid for all the classes and exams, fees, etc upfront for around $1,500 (tbf it’s through a training medspa specifically for this and there was a huge discount if you just bought all the courses upfront). The apprentice license was a 40 hour theory course, a 20 question exam, and then 2 days of practical application - actually using the laser on people. And boom, according to TX, you’re ready for a LHR medspa job in approximately 55 hours!

But again, I paid for all the courses upfront and extra trainings and stuff you don’t technically need in TX but I just want to be very knowledgeable and thus hire-able. Tattoo removal training is even cheaper from my understanding but I haven’t looked at the pricing of those courses lately.

A full Aesthetician license in ATX runs about $12-20k for comparison.

Edit: results will *vary wildly* because TX is the wild west out here y’all. There was a woman in my class from CA who was required to be some kind of RN to practice any kind of aesthetics in CA.

ALSO: if you’re worried about the customer service aspect of this field in regards to LHR and tattoo removal specifically, I’ve had both for years and years and am still getting treated and, even on large areas of my body, it goes very quickly so there’s not much chatting going on except checking in about the pain level.",3,1703455273.0,kesjwna

>Also, even though you don’t need a bachelors degree, you need a 2 year associate degree and pass a national board exam.

Yes, I'm aware a college diploma (called an ""associate's degree"" in the US) is required. Some of the other career options I mentioned also require a college diploma.

Note regarding terms: from a Canadian/non-U.S. perspective, colleges and universities are two very different types of institutions. **Colleges** provide education and practical training in applied fields like graphic design, IT, vet tech, practical nursing, culinary arts, etc. These programs are typically 2 years and grant college diplomas (American equivalent is an associate's degree). **Universities** are theory-based, degree-granting institutions. This is where you go for your bachelors and Masters degrees or PhD in fields like public policy, international relations, biochemistry, commerce, civil engineering and so on. You also have professional programs like medicine, law and so on. The term ""degree"" is solely related to bachelors, Masters, PhDs or professional degrees (MD, etc) outside the U.S.",1,1703606128.0,kezxmg4

I thought maybe I was just being lazy, but after reading some Reddit posts I see I’m not alone. I have LITERALLY held over 30 jobs and I’m only 28 years old. I’m not proud to admit it but it’s true.

I have numerous degrees (masters degree in economics, grad cert in Project Management, PMP certification, bachelors in psychology) so I’m not “lazy” but I HATE working & feeling like my entire life is working & sleeping then repeating that process.

The only way out IMO is to save a lump sum of money & become a successful day trader. Idrc about being a billionaire or anything I just want enough to support a family & do what I want when I want & I know it’s possible.

My family always said things like “go to college, get a degree, & get a good job”. One day I told some family members I no longer wanted to work & all the adults looked at me confused / ashamed & one said “you just don’t know what you want to do yet”. Yes I do, I want to be free from this mental prison of work sleep work sleep work.

We weren’t made to work our entire lives for scraps!

1/29/24 UPDATE: Still not enjoying work that much but there are some good moments. I have started back going to gym 5am before work which helps me relieve stress & feel better physically / mentally while at work. I also communicate with all associates & basically all customers I come across which helps me stay positive while working.

I’m also honing my day trading skills (I made a 25% profit off day trading today). I willl show all the doubters that I can do this long term, although I understand where you all are coming from in terms of risks and how it’s rare to see people successfully day trade long-term.

I'm in a similar boat to you and am currently trying to figure out this for myself as well.

I hate working in the traditional sense (a 9 to 5), too, so I'm exploring options such as content creation, working a part-time job (the less miserable hours the better), and freelancing while moving back in with my aging parents.

I've tried being a digital nomad, too, and to save you some time it's not worth it if you find having a stable base important.

What it was good for, however, was rapidly changing the way I thought about life, society, and the world; namely realizing that time with family, and friends, is more important than money (to an extent).

It also helped me realize that shame from family members and society is based on their limited perspective of life; you have to trust your self and others who have forged a path similar to that which you want to follow, and tune out those who haven't gotten where you want to be.

Money is a currency less important than time, but what it can allow you is to buy back your time - this seems to be what you're seeking.

I want to ask you what sacrifices can you currently make (or rather are you willing to make)  to work less, so that you have a greater work-life balance and get more time to focus on really figuring out a path unique to you that will light you up, even if you never fully realize your initial goal of early retirement.

I'm also trying to get in tune with my inner guidance for what makes me feel alive and passionate to teach and help others (to base my content creation goals on), as having a bigger motivation outside of oneself can help with the unease working a corporate job often gives us (that soulless dread).

If you find the concept of intuition and trusting yourself foreign, consider that we also tried for a very long time listening to the outside world which told us to get a college degree and a ""good job"" and look where it got us in the end; in debt and miserable from working a bunch of jobs under the misguided illusion that working for the man is honorable or ""worth it"".

It shouldn't be an issue that you have strong feelings that you hate work because humans weren't designed to work in a capitalistic society. It's a sign that you know there's something wrong with it and have the strength to question how life should and could be.

Good luck!

findapath,skilled trade,comment,19do520,,"There's a very simple answer actually.

Take a realistic estimate of your average annual expenses for your desired lifestyle and divide it by somewhere between 0.02 and 0.04, depending on how tolerant you are to risk. Just do 0.03 if you don't know.

You plan to spend $40k/year? Then you need $1.3M. You plan to spend $100k/year? $3.3M.

That's in current day dollars, already deals with average inflation rate.

Most people spend every additional dollar they make. If you do this you can never retire no matter how much you make. Being frugal is just as important as making more money. If you spend twice as much you need to save twice as much.

That 3% is an estimate for safe withdrawal rate. Basically, you're assuming your returns will be on the low end of historical average (~5%), and inflation will be a on target (~2%), which subtracted together leave 3% every year. Or it could be higher returns and inflation, whatever. At a 2% withdrawal rate you can have very little risk in your portfolio (more bonds and dividends), at 4% you need a little more (more exposure to growth stocks, etc, just like a normal index fund). If you don't understand that just buy VTI and assume 3% it's fine.

You want it to be conservative because realistically your expenses for things like insurance will go up when you're older, so you want to leave some growth.

Most day traders lose everything. You have a distorted view of reality because on social media people only post wins, and often they do that so they can make their actual money selling scam courses to people like you. It's actually really easy to fake being good at day trading, and it's extremely lucrative to scam people after faking that.

I've indirectly seen the books for a large day trading influencer who drives a Lamborghini Aventador (~$600k car). He made ~$10M in that year. That was ~$10,100,000 in course sales teaching people to trade stocks and a ~$100k net loss on stock trades. On net across all of the years we saw he lost money on stocks.

People assume he's good at trading stocks because he is rich (which he actually is) and talks about day trading. But he loses money trading stocks, screenshots just the inevitable random minority of wins from rolling dice, and then makes a fortune scamming people like you into thinking there's a get rich quick scheme he can sell you, when really the way he got rich was scamming people like you by selling a false dream.

I have some experience day trading and can tell you that it's a full time job. You have to always be researching 24/7 to stay ahead of the competition; you need to read trades, do analysis, keep a tab on both domestic and international news, constantly be reading financial reports, etc. and despite all of that effort only less then 1% of day traders can survive long-term.

None of this seems like you've put any real effort into figuring out what you actually want. It's just a rant against working and you're only 28yrs old.

I hate going to work 40hrs, maybe as much as you do. So for the past 10 years I've been planning an early retirement escape. In 10 years of investing and not blowing money on cars and not overbuying on housing, I've taken my net worth from 100k to 1.2M

2 - 30 jobs by 28?  Makes it sound like you've just hopped around.  Makes it sound like as soon as the honeymoon period of the new job wears off, and you start having days where you don't wanna go in, you quit.  

Tbh I'd find someone to talk to, someone you trust and will actually listen to, and ask them for advice.  You push off the notion of ""you don't know what you wanna do yet"" then immediately say you want to start a business??  Look deeper inside.  I can almost guarantee you that the reason you don't like working, isn't that you don't like working, and until you figure it out you won't be able to have a stable life.

That said, if you really want to basically retire early, its literally just a math game.  Very basic math.  Figure an estimated age of death, maybe add 5 years for the sake of it, estimate how much money you need a year to live, multiply that by how many estimated years you have left to live.  Should also take into account inflation, so maybe increase the amount you need by like 5% or so every year.

Example

50 years to live at 50k you'd need like 3 mil or so? Maybe a bit less?

findapath,skilled trade,comment,19do520,,"Determining the exact amount of money one needs to quit a 9-5 job is not a straightforward answer as it varies depending on a variety of factors. However, with proper planning, it's possible to identify the ideal financial cushion to make the transition from a 9-5 job to pursuing your passions.  
Firstly, it's important to take stock of your current expenses, including rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, entertainment, and other essential living expenses. Next, determine the amount of money you will need to cover these expenses for at least six months. This financial cushion will give you peace of mind as you explore new opportunities and business ventures.  
It's also crucial to consider the costs of health insurance, taxes, and other necessary expenses that come with being self-employed or running a business. By factoring in all of these costs and expenses, you can determine the ideal amount of money to have saved up before quitting your 9-5 job.  
Ultimately, the decision to leave your 9-5 job should not only be based on financial considerations but also on your passion and drive to pursue your goals.

But you’re in reaction, so it’s hard to self-regulate. 

We were all born into this world and had to enter the capitalist system we’re now a part of. It is what it is. It’s a matrix, for sure. 

The game here is not to take it as reality. Sure, working for someone else could suck. But it could also be an opportunity to learn, develop professionally, and test your character. 

Our expectations get us. We assume there’s another way “out,” but the only sure way is through. But that’s not what people want to hear. 

However, it’s easy. What makes it difficult is the same thinking that says it should be another way. 

Society has programmed people not to think for themselves. So when you go with the current flow, you might not like the destination, be concerned about what else you’re missing out on, etc. 

The only thing you need to do is decide to be where you are right now. Decide how your circumstances can aid you in a larger vision. 

Without goals the signs of progress, we suffer. Make your job work for you. Aim for excellence. 

Here’s the thing. Even if you had a billion dollars and free time, it wouldn’t make you happy. Being happy is a decision. It’s taking an active role in how you interpret the world.

findapath,skilled trade,comment,19do520,,"A good way to figure out roughly how much you need to save would be to read up on the FIRE movement's [4% rule](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/). There's a lot of detractors to this currently, but the 4% rule is a good ballpark way to understand how your money can work for you and provide freedom. So I'd start there!

Next, your hating 9-to-5 work got me interested. I also HATE 9-to-5 work and am working towards setting myself free. The idea I've really keyed into is that if I could do something that inspires/energizes/resonates, I would be happy to do it. But the crux is that I hate doing it for someone else/when someone else is in charge of me, you know?

Maybe a good self-discovery journey you could try around that is this:
1. Take the [High 5 strengths test](https://high5test.com/)(free)
2. Get out a journal, and do the following exercise for each of your 5 strengths:
2a. Rewrite the strength in your own words.
2b. Write out the shadow aspects of that strength. (Shadow aspects = every strength has a dark side. For example, if you are really strong in empathy, you may turn to people pleasing or losing your sense of self as your shadow)
2c. Write out the ""cure"" for those shadows. Your cure can be things like being aware of certain things, creating boundaries around other things, embracing things you've been stuffing down.

This might seem really random, but this is why I suggest it: when I did this I uncovered that I'm a creative, entrepreneurial person who likes to break down barriers and invent new things. I like work that is flexible and dynamic. 

But - I currently work for the government. I can't think of anything more opposite of what I just described above except maybe being in the military. So it was really revealing and empowering, like 'ok, THIS is why I hate work.' Because it's not aligned at all with who I really am. 

So maybe if you try it, you will uncover some things about yourself that can guide you on your path. It could show you what type of work would actually be fulfilling - or maybe you need to strike out on your own and do your own thing, like make your own money and work on your own terms. I suggest this because your feelings of absolutely hating 9-to-5 strongly reminded me of myself. 

So basically, radically save up your own money, and make some more money in a way that doesn't crush your soul.",1,1706052743.0,kj9s9ec

Service business - with your degrees this should be easy, just set yourself up as an independent consultant in whatever professional area you've got the interest in / training for, then go to wix or squarespace or wordpress and buy yourself a domain and a website, and list it on google business and buy some google ads, start a social media channel (youtube, tiktok, instagram, facebook, whatever), start networking, and voila you're in business. (Your locality may require a business license, and you may want to set up an LLC once you're making some money, but there's no real rush.)

Product business - get a shopify site, figure out what products you want to sell, list them on your site, buy some google ads, start a social media channel, start networking, and voila, you're in business.

You do not want a laundromat or a vending machine route or a car wash if you hate working. Have you ever seen a slacker working at a car wash or a laundromat? I haven't. Those folks work twice as hard as I ever have, for much less money. Sure, they're working FOR the owner, but guess who has to fill in when a handful of staff get sick or hungover, and guess who has to know how to do all of their work as well if not better? That's the owner, and that's you. You do not want to be that guy. 

Honestly though, what you really want is a sabbatical. Take a year or so off, get it out of your system, then go back to the day job. Sure, day jobs suck, but slowly going broke while hating your ""dream job"" is so much worse.

Otherwise, just start a side hustle, and when it covers your bills, quit the day job. If it doesn't get to that point, you'll be glad to have the day job to fall back on.",1,1706078267.0,kjbfdai

1.	⁠save up 4-6 months of full expenses so you can stay afloat: definitely makes sense


2.	⁠think of what you're good at and if ANY of those things can help you start something: I don’t think I want to go the business route. I know I said that in my original post but I realize that is not actually what I want to do.


3.	⁠have a solid idea that you want to do, even better if its a service or other soft skill you can use to earn you money: many people come to me for advice, and general opinion seeking. I would really like to be a guidance counselor of some sort, but I don’t think that I would want to create a business at this time.


4.	⁠while you do your big idea, can you do something else as the meantime in freelance to get some money in because without your 9-5 you have many hours and unless you will do 100% focused work everyday you wont use all those hours productively so might as well use some of it to get some money in: well I currently deliver products for Walmart and Amazon. It is definitely great for supplemental income, but not something I would necessarily do full-time. You are definitely better than me at saving. I am not sure that I could live off of 14 K per year I currently make 80 K.


5.	⁠Please don't gamble away your money.. if by that you mean don’t daytrade I’m sorry but deep down I genuinely feel like daytrading is my path. I have much experience with it, and I have seen with proper planning that you can profit from daytrading in the long run.

The downside potential is huge. Once you lose your money on a risky trade, you're out of the game. You don't get any more lives, you don't get second chances, you're out. You've turned a pipe dream of financial security into an absolute nightmare--what happens once rent's due? An unforeseen medical expense? A burst pipe? You've literally gambled away your savings.

The probability of losing all of your investment at any point FAR exceeds the probability of doubling your investment at any point. The expected value of portfolio will almost always be lower than the index fund. Before you say ""but you've done this for years and are experienced at it"", let me remind you that people who have dedicated their entire lives to solving math equations, programming computers to run 0.3% faster than their competitors, with millions if not billions of cushion and drawdown tolerance lose out more often than not.

findapath,skilled trade,comment,19do520,,"Friend, you have clearly done zero work to understand the economics of starting a business, nor have you seemingly talked to anyone who has ever even seen a business owner. 

If you want to start something like a car wash, look up what commercial real estate in your area goes for. Now double that, as a rough guess, for clearing/grading/construction. This is going to take at least 6 months, so you’ve got to pay for everything and be very cash flow negative for at least half a year. Then you start up and you’ve got to consistently replace all the things your idiot customers are breaking, plus regular maintenance. Now you can start making money, but spoiler… it’s probably not enough to live on the way you think, because the margins on car washes just aren’t that great. 

Most people that start a business like this did it because they either had a lot of money available already or they got financing when it was substantially easier to get.

I have some bad news for you: the options involved for you only include working or investing in sweat equity. And you seem too lazy for sweat equity. The reason you earn more on your own businesses is because you are responsible for everything.

the goal here isnt to have a graph of what you want vs where you are (which may be depressing at times). It's to have a visual reminder, so that your goals are kept in mind on a daily basis, on an hourly basis, on a minute by minute basis if possible.  

it doesnt do you any good to just have the image, if you don't keep it in your mind. You have to look at it in the morning, afternoon, and evening; and go ""ok, i want to continue on this path I charted out XYZ day ago. how can I progress along the path now?"". and you have to do that, 10, 50, 100 times a day.

I would be asking questions and digging deeper instead of wasting your time telling people they’re wrong. 

From a quick search, average annual pre-tax income of franchise owners in America is $80,000. Only 7% of franchise owners earn more than $250,000 annually, and 51% earn less than $50,000. The average and below average numbers are not enough for you to get rich quick and retire. Owning multiple franchises is likely the path to earning in the top 5% plus. 

It’s also not easy to be a franchise owner. There are many prerequisites to even be considered for ownership of a franchise, especially for big name, historically profitable franchises. Many of these standards are based on your financial history and current state. 

It also shows poor business acumen that you’d use family as your company accountants. It can create a conflict of interest. Do you plan on putting them on payroll, or are they expected to do this as a (long term) favor? You probably have to have legal step in for explicit contracts that protect your company if they are involved with the numbers at all.

If you are open 10 hours a day for 350 days a year and want to have at least one employee on the clock at all times at 12 dollars an hour that is 42k gone from the 140k. After corporate taxes, cost of supplies, marketing and such you will be operating a loss. It takes about 4 years for a successful car wash to turn a profit.

Go run a carwash if you want? Why would I care?

Off the top of my head short list: 

* Payroll can be difficult. It can be expensive and time consuming. There are many regulations and laws that dictate how it is done.
* Insurance and understanding your liabilities and coverage needs can be difficult and expensive.
* Staffing & scheduling can be very difficult.
* Dealing with the public, especially when things go wrong and you damage their car, can be very difficult.
* Marketing and understanding your demographics can take a lot of work too.
* Dealing with maintenance of any machinery can be very expensive and difficult.
* Waste water, water reclamation, environmental regulations from city/county/state/fed can change over time and be difficult.
* Permitting can be difficult
* Providing good customer service is very difficult for most people.
* Dealing with PCI compliance, payments, day-to-day administrative tasks, paying bills, taking deliveries, hiring, firing, on and on.  


You going to build a new one or buy an existing? Do you know the permitting process to build something like this? The costs? Do you know your demographics? Ho many customers per day do you need to break even? How much do you lose per hour during an outage or breakdown?

Few details about me: I'm in my late 30s, living in Texas, with only a high school diploma. Concerns about the cost of higher education held me back from pursuing further degrees. Despite this, I've built a varied career since I started working at 18. My experience spans Customer Support (phone, chat, and email), Sales Management, Risk Analysis in tech, and periods in construction and the oil industry. Currently, I work as a Due Diligence Agent at a tech company. Over the years, I've accumulated 8.5 years in customer support, 1 year in sales management, 2.5 years as a risk analyst, and 2 years in construction and oil.

  
Financially, I earn about $42K annually, maintain a 771 credit score, and am managing to pay off 5% debt accrued from unexpected expenses last year. However, I face challenges such as saving for a 20% down payment on a house, building a significant retirement account, and setting aside funds for my children’s education or skilled trade training.

  
I'm seeking advice on enhancing my financial stability and advancing my career to provide better for my family. Any guidance on improving my financial situation and career path would be greatly appreciated.

As a 50 something mom who was a really lost 20 year old, I am here to tell you that you do not have to have it all figured out in your 20s! Seriously you don't  - and you know what, you will be OK.  


College is not the only path - I never went, neither did my husband and we do just fine - even in NJ where it is expensive as hell. I cannot count the number of jobs I held before I found my passion in web design and SEO in my early-30s.   


My husband was totally lost working a dead end job in a tire warehouse - he went to trade school, started at the bottom and now holds a high level job in the industry.   


You are 20-something,  still figuring out who you even are. Who you are now, is not who you will be in 10 years. Just enjoy the time and focus on the things that bring you happiness - and see if you can make that into a career.  


It has literally never been a better time to be a 20-something in many ways. You have the ability to CREATE a job for yourself. AI, SEO, web design, creative design, [skilled trades](https://bluecollarbrain.com/list-of-skilled-trades/) \- these are all opportunities for you.   


Just push yourself outside your comfort zone.   


Life is not always easy - or fair, but you have all the control you need to make it what you want it to be.

Ive worked in the skilled trades for most of 20s. Now I'm in my late 20s. Despite being a very high demand industry and people think it's amazing on Reddit. But I've always felt this feeling in my stomach like I couldn't see myself doing it long term. I feel very unfulfilled and not really in tuned with work. 
I come home from work even when I haven't worked particularly hard I'm exhaused. I just sit on my couch and watch tv.

I don't get any excitement or highs in my line of work. It's soul crushing to me really. 

The reson I've been doing it this long is because I'm scared to try something new and cost of living is so high these days I don't wanna try something new and risk burning my 3 month emergency fund 

Really I wish my line of work was exciting and I got highs from it. My work is boring, technical and labour intensive and I don't get much satisfaction from it. 

I've long wanted to try sales of some sort. But I don't want to sell people things they don't need and would like a consistent pay. 

Ive also considered becoming a city transit bus driver as I feel I am a good driver but I do smoke cannabis(Canada)  sometimes and it's not allowed being a driver.

I feel a line of work where I do the same thing everyday would be best for me. Skilled trades is constant problem solving and curve balls thrown at you which I do not enjoy

You can definitely find a position for 60k a year if you negotiate well and do your job full time 40 hours a week from 11pm to 7am. It’s “front desk” so you’ll have to interact with a few guest but if you work M-F or better yet Sun-Thrus you’ll be dealing with business folks and not some drunken party folks. You’ll have “decent” benefits, shitty dental/Health insurance. You have to keep in mind it’s hospitality so you have to be half decent and superficially “nice” but most of time it’s a cake walk. Your paid to “run numbers”, basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but the computer system they teach you to use is simple. Stick the correct number here and click print type of stuff. But it’s easy about maybe 2 hours of “real” work. The rest you’re paid to make sure the place doesn’t burn down and to check in guest that show up hella late. Personally I think you are going to have to compromise your “normal” schedule. Night shift will HAVE to be your best option. Hotels and all 24 hour business have a hard time filling night shift positions bc no one wants to work nights but for you it sounds perfect. You’ll just have outfit your home to accommodate sleeping during the day. Most people quit night shift bc um their body can’t “take” it after a while. But I personally enjoyed night shift work. Now here’s the thing you’ll have to do almost ever single hotel is franchised so sometimes one Hilton will pay decent and have a decent general manager and sometimes they don’t so you have to get the location. You are better off going corporate for better benefits and being “treated” better by management but they do expect more. However, everyone knows a night shift is hella boring so you’ll be able to watch shows or read during your shift which is pretty sweet. Also, everyone knows the night shift people are a little weird so they don’t expect you to be like a super extrovert they just want to find someone normalish that won’t freak out a guest if they need help at night. If you come off as a creep they will not hire you. But if you are half way normal the job is gold. Boring as all hell but hey if the goal is, 40 hrs, almost no effort and decent pay then I don’t think you could do better. Plus, night audit is considered a “management” position in a weak way, bc you aren’t “management” but you do have authority bc you are the only one in the building most likely. So you can kick some drunk dude out if he or she is being a dick to you and you will almost never be reprimanded for that bc of “safety”. So what you want is a “business” hotel NEVER a vacation resort or anywhere that could attract children for team sports (you might have to deal with a few of those even in a business hotel but if it’s 2am and a guest calls bc some kids are being loud as hell while they are trying to sleep you don’t have to super nice about telling them to go the f to bed) you want a medium sized hotel (larger hotels with more then 150 rooms will most likely have more then one person on shift for the night) and you’ll only have to see a co-worker that you release which a “bye dude here’s all the stuff that happened in the hotel and this room is bitch watch out” and the cowoker at 7am that releases you and you go “bye, here’s the stuff that happened…nothing”. I know this is a lot of information but I hope it helps. Btw, if you are going through something working a job like this makes you face your demons pretty quickly, most hotels can’t find someone to fill this role more then 2 years bc humans need humans and communication.

I find myself wanting to be busier and I’m lonely after a few years now that I have so much downtime and other people have jobs and kids you’re trying to distract yourself and not be bored 98% of the day and it’s not as great as it sounds you think right now you have lots of hobbies and you do get tired of doing it all alone

There was a study done that said, most people who are the most happy only have about three hours of downtime a day .. I find when I have that amount I’m happy- more or less than that- I’m not..

Life also seems so purposeless … there’s no coworkers to connect with because there’s no real job. I don’t do any meaningful work or make an impact - I just get paid and I still don’t really like what I do ..I guess kind of… but I found myself asking for more work and there just isn’t more work and I honestly have been looking for jobs just to be busier and feel like I make a difference somewhere

Because right now I don’t do anything meaningful in a relationship or at work or anywhere. It’s like nothing matters, and there is no purpose and you’re constantly trying to find something to distract boredom 

I’ve tried volunteering, online games, starting businesses, blogging, working out, meet ups.

I have friends who are lucky enough to also not have to work and they say the same - it’s not as great as it sounds … should we shop again.. again.. same as yesterday? There’s two hours, now what for the next 14 hours.. and what to do for 16 hours tomorrow?! You can only take so many naps.. there’s a reason retired people go back to work

I live in a large expensive city (Denver). I own a 553 sq condo my mortgage is 826 a month and my HOA is 215 which covers all utilities except wifi and electricity, so that’s max an extra 200 a month MAX. I don’t have a car payment but when I was making 53k a year I still felt like I couldn’t afford anything and frankly 73 should get me a town home not a fucking studio and I own that bitch so it’s an investment. I charge my tenant market rent which is 1350! 1350! You fucking tell me how anyone making 53k a year who is single so literally no fucking tax breaks affords that!

So legit tell me what your monthly expenses are like rent to see how legitimately how “high on the hog” you feel at 53k.

findapath,skilled trade,post,17fktrz,Telling dumb people like me that we're not dumb is unhelpful.,"Stop inundating people like me with patronizing platitudes about how we're not actually dumb, since we managed to write a post on Reddit. 

We're looking for jobs for dumb people, and your replies are completely unhelpful.

So is the played out, low-hanging fruit joke, ""become a politician."" Politicians are far smarter than most Americans. George W. Bush, the supposed dumb politician, scored 1206 on his SAT. That's better than 75% of all SAT test takers. 

Donald Trump made himself into a world famous billionaire, and became the President of the United States when most mainstream media was on a crusade to keep him from winning. No matter what you think of him, he's a brilliant marketer. ""Make America Great Again"" never specifies when America was great, and that's the genius of it. It can mean something different for everybody. 

So no, when people like me come on here telling you we're dumb and can't learn skills, we're not just lacking self-esteem. Self-esteem comes from success. 

Here's how you can help us: There are mentally retarded people who have jobs. What kinds of jobs do those people have?

Truthfully, work at Kroger. I used to work there as a cashier but preferred bagging groceries and stocking the aisles any day of the week.

Kroger hires everyone, no matter the compentance of the person.

The questions were directed toward who you were as a person and I don't remember a single question being about the job itself aside from my availability and desired position.

Unless you're actually disabled, this information won't be especially helpful for you, because some employers have access to credits for hiring the disabled:

https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/tax-benefits-for-businesses-who-have-employees-with-disabilities

On top of that, employers can offer subminimum wage to ""individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a physical or mental disability"":

https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/subminimumwage

In other words: you won't earn a living wage, and what little you get paid may even be subsidized by the government through tax credits to the employer.

But, if you just want to work a job, regardless of pay, because you find it fulfilling, and you qualify as mentally or physically disabled, there are social service programs operated by each state government for job placement assistance with companies that offer employment to the disabled.

Here's just one company that offers such employment that I found with a quick Google search:

https://hcocenter.org/

But, if you're not disabled and you're thinking ""if they'll employ a disabled person, they'll certainly employ me"" -- probably not.  Because they'll have to pay you minimum wage, which the job probably isn't economically feasible at that cost, and they won't receive the tax credit, making you cost them even more to employ.",1,1698278479.0,k6gx0bo

Liberals have canonically focused on marginalized people, so not sure what's so ""neo"" about it. But even then, their leanings on socio-economic factors ( leftist ) doesn't necessarily tie into social justice. Sure, they're aligned that way in modern US politics, but that's because we have two political entities in America.

Asian Americans have the highest average household income in the US. No one is ""keeping Asian Americans out of university"". It's absolutely ludicrous if you legitimately feel that's happening.

This is not what the ruling says, nor what Blum argued. He did not argue it was weighted more, and the Supreme Court did not say that. The fact that is was a factor at all was the crux of the case, UNC and Harvard effectively argued it was a factor among many, and not weighted any higher than others. The fact it was a factor at all was the crux of the ruling.

findapath,skilled trade,comment,17fktrz,,"You can spout conspiratorial mischaracterization of the argument, but again, there is more data out there. It just seems you're setting the standard really high, considering the left leaning social science departments aren't in a rush to investigate this necessarily, or if so it will take some time for this research to emerge. My point is DEI ideology leads to this. I've asked roughly how many recorded cases of this do you need for it to be generalization as a trend/pattern impacting US college admissions and have yet to hear a number. I'm sure no matter what I bring up, it can be dismissed as non-representative/cherry picked, etc. This is something that was happening under Affirmative Actions legally in top Universities, it's very likely this is happening elsewhere as well.

You are acting like Affirmative Action isn't a federal policy utilized by most schools that encourages consideration of race on top of merit in admissions, and sometimes over merit for select spots to meet the diversity, equity and inclusion criteria. What evidence do you need exactly? To pretend this is some isolated Harvard incident and hammer on some aggregate evidence is just being pedantic about it. Thankfully it is no longer legal.

The whole thing just sounds like some neck-beard dialectal materialist screaming ShOW Me MUH DaTA when you can just look at legal precedent and surmise that it's likely happening all over the nation, because Affirmative Action and DEI bureaucrats overlap in producing equity of outcome and enforcing Affirmative Action, which means as has been show in the case two applicants with equal merit will be sorted based on their race, and if you're Asian, you'll likley end up at a lower caliber school. And I'm the one who is terminally online?

Alright finally about how much race is weighed. It was clearly weighed some indirectly using a personality inventory that produced lower scores universally among Asians (and likely designed for such purpose). If two people with identical academics and therefore identical merit are admitted using this inventory then the Asian student will be considered to be not meet the criteria, therefore the non merit-based criteria is effectively racist. So yes, in this case with two individuals of the same merit, race is the deciding factor and therefore discrimination based on race is an accurate description. That's the crux of my argument. They created an admissions process likely designed to decrease enrollment of Asian applicants or maybe have done so unwittingly as that is the outcome.  


As for DEI and Affirmative action and college admissions, I think they overlap in the kind of training and the person receives, and trajectories of those who work in them, often having a social science background or english, generally leaning left a lot of the time. They are tasked with similar goals of socially engineering equality of outcome and compensating for real or perceived inequalities. I think their mindsets are similar enough that allows racist selection criteria to be normalized in Harvard. Ideologically they either left or social justice advocates and often not the most competent. It's a weak argument, but they likely share a belief system in regards to equality of outcome, as clearly they have no qualms administering programs that compensate for past racism with current racism towards a different group. 

I think it's very likely they feel a free pass to be racist against Asians on the count that they are doing better financially so therefore labeled ""white adjacent"" or other such term which effectively means uncle Tom for supporting and excelling in the  Free Market.)",1,1698258435.0,k6fft73

My advice to you would be to find a career path you think you’d actually enjoy for the most part and can support your lifestyle, and not simply seek something that fits your amorphous sense of duty or purpose.",2,1717377299.0,l6uj6u8

findapath,skilled trade,comment,1d6phvo,,"My rec would be start working and making money. There is always time to study more, change careers later.  A sociology degree is fairly worthless unless you're doing higher education and don't want to start working for years.

The ""essential workers"" thing was a completely novel reaction in the history of mankind. Not sure if they will do something like that again in the future, but if you're looking for job security, consider the massive amounts of healthcare workers who have left the profession after that. According to the internet ""Seventeen percent of nurses quit their position within the first year of their careers—a whopping 56 percent left within the first five years. The average career length for nurses is now **nine years.""**

If you really want to do it then do it, just be prepared if it's more grueling than you expect. There are healthcare shortages and I know many nurses in a variety of fields. They change their jobs or working positions every few years and often complain about the management and frustrations of the job.  

It's very unlikely that you will experience something different. 

It sounds like you have a hard time making up your mind and sticking to finishing something if this is the second time you've dropped out of school. I would focus on finishing something and transitioning into a job ASAP. Then you can work and do RN training if that's still what you want to do. 

I also posted above, that you could volunteer cosmetology services to cancer patients, or other ill hospitalized people. There are ways to serve people and a community more than just your job. Try doing some volunteering or working in nursing homes. See what nurses do and deal with every day. Find some people you can shadow. Or try to find fulfillment in soup kitchens, homeless shelters, etc. 

There are tons of people who need help and if you feel strongly that is what you want to do, you could start that now. You don't need a job in that field to help people. People often burn out when their job comes from an idealized passion for something imo.",1,1717382057.0,l6uu5xc

I just see a lot of people languishing in school  to get a degree but not really being able to transition it into a job and winding up pretty lost later. Also, the debt problem is huge. 

When you're in your twenties it feels like you have to figure everything out all at once for the rest of your life. I'm a bit older than you and I'm starting to realize that many people change careers, and go in different directions, or have a more variable life/work path. It's part of what makes life exciting. You don't have to do it all immediately. Just keep working towards something you want and be willing to continue to do that as you grow older. 

Since you're in this sub you're obviously trying to find the right direction. Sometimes just getting out there and being able to work can help you focus on what you like/don't like to do, as well as supporting you, while you embark on learning or transitioning  into something new. 

I think I just worried about you because you sound very idealistic which is wonderful, but nursing can be a very hard profession. Sticking with something where you don't have much agency to make change and in a high stress situation can be very difficult and I think we need MORE people who are idealistic and hopeful and want to help. That's why I mentioned volunteering.

findapath,electrician,post,1948o6a,Stenographer or Electrician,"    Hello I’m a 23M and I’m stuck between these two paths. I have a cousin a few years older than me who’s an electrician and just became a journeyman making good money. I would follow his path however I am hesitant because I can’t help but think long term about how my body will degrade and possible hazards, dangers, and discomfort of the job. He also is making ~$100,000 a year now in San Diego. 

    Now his girlfriend is a stenographer and once she gets licensed I heard from my cousin she will be making more than him, around $100,000 to $120,000 a year. To be honest the environment of steno seems to fit a lot more with me as I never imagined myself in the field, tough job where I’m too tired to even go to the gym. I love the idea of making that amount of money and not having a ruined body or one that is going downhill when I’m older. I know they can have problems with their hands, but I like that more than electrician problems as my dad was in trades and I’ve heard stories from him.

findapath,electrician,post,1d0z5dm,I detest being an electrician. Want/need something WFH but what are my options?,"Pretty typical story I guess. Gifted and talented throughout school, good results came easy, huge interest in a creative medium but grew up working class/underclass so was heavily directed toward getting a trade.

Did that straight from school (electrician) and hated it. When the company I did my apprenticeship went under I decided against continuing and had my lost weekend (around 8 years) where I worked random jobs, went back to college the Uni, got a degree, explored teaching including teaching abroad for a year, decided against it, worked a few office roles and a few sales roles. Before returning to construction (best money available and easiest work environment) but I really hate it.

I've been back as an electrician for six years now. I went back to college to get more qualified but still have to do more to get my gold card (fully accredited electrician) but I just have no interest in putting the time, energy and money in to doing that. I want out.

I want to work from home so I can work on my fiction writing and entrepreneurial endeavours. I don't really care what it is doing but I've been trying to do this for maybe three years and it hasn't happened at all. I always end up having to take up another electrical job and I pretty much hate every second of it.

My partner and I have worked hard to get all of our expenses down so that we don't require me to earn as much as I do as an electrician any more (though obviously more money always helps), we could do just fine with me on minimum wage to be honest £20k+

Also we're moving home in the next few months. From the Midlands to a village in South Wales. Me being an electrician isn't exactly viable after the move and obviously if I could get a WFH job it would make life a lot easier with us living somewhere quite remote.

I've tried a lot of the typical, easy, entry level roles that Google throws up but none have led to an actual viable role. Is there a job out there that suits what I'm looking for? Or am I better off doing some intensive training course to get a WFH job? (I'm a little dubious on the latter because as much as I think I'd like something in web/app/software development people train their whole lives for that, surely I can't just do a quick course and get in?)

In an ideal world I could skip the middle man (some WFH job) and start on an entrepreneur path right away but I've got to pay the bills and I haven't been able to find anything that can make me £40ish per day within a few weeks.

Sorry it's such a long read and big ask but what are my options? As I say I hate the whole electrician/construction industry and it will only be harder once we move home. I've applied for plenty of WFH jobs or jobs in other industries (even commission only sales) but I don't get any replies).",1,1716722231.0,

If I continue working as an electrician I'll struggle to get anything commutable and I really don't fancy working away again.

Walking dogs and pet sitting sounds like an absolute dream, being able to dedicate time to writing and other ventures too! The whole career or earning as much as possible does not interest me in the slightest. 

The majority of the last six years has been waking up before 5am, being out the house for over 14 hours, staying away from home for work and working weekends.

I just want to wake up at a normal time, earn what is needed (from home if possible) and have time for my family and myself. I wonder if pet care will be an option in the little village we are moving to, or what similar jobs are out there I could do.",2,1716837784.0,l5x8x1l
findapath,electrician,comment,1d0z5dm,,"I totally understand. I’m not motivated by tons of money either, just enough to live comfortably. I’ve always wanted to do work that benefits me, and that mainly points to good life balance. There is always a need for pet care, even small towns and villages will need someone to take care of them. So many reasons why. You could find the local veterinarian and negotiate a partnership as a pet taxi to bring pets to them from the clients. 

The company I work for does pet taxis, house sitting, overnight stays, dog walking, pet sitting, dog training, cat training, bird training, garden sitting, pool care, animal rescue, and pet fostering. You can make a good business out of even one of those things. And do it anywhere. There will always be a need for pet care in the world. So many people have pets, and whom want to go on vacations, or need help with their pets while at work. 

Think of a busy corporate job or someone like you who is at work for 14 hours, they always wanted a dog and so they bought a puppy, but they don’t have enough time in the day to devote hours to train the puppy, that’s where you come in and spend a couple hours stay while their gone and train the puppy so the house doesn’t get messed up. Or the opposite, it’s a geriatric dog that’s got problems. 

I have clients that are elderly and even though they are healthy they can’t walk their dogs because they aren’t strong enough. 

You can easily cater to specific needs. It’s very versatile.

findapath,electrician,post,18ekrc1,25M Seeking advice on choosing a trade (excluding Electrician) - Which one to choose?," 

The  only reason I excluded 'electrician' in the title is that I tried to  get into a union apprenticeship years ago, but being extremely red/green  colorblind ended that pursuit. I'm a 25-year-old male in the southern  USA. My work experience includes a year in maintenance at a flea market  and the rest in retail customer service. I decided to give college a try  and completed a general AA degree to transfer to a Computer Science  Degree. However, while I loved the math aspect, I hated the programming  section of the degree. Unsure of what to major in after, I withdrew from  college. I have a working knowledge of basic tools(working on  cars/doing some roofing/basic house maintenance), but nothing beyond  that.

The main trades I'm  considering are machinist, plumber, pipefitter, welding, or carpentry.  Plumbing and Machinist roles seem the most interesting to me, but I'm  unsure which would be better long-term. I know that with plumbing, I  could apply for a union job and train as a journeyman. However, for  machinists, I'm not sure how to start—should I get a certification from a  community college first, or start directly with a company that provides  training?

My friends, who are  welders and mechanics, advised me against welding, but I'm open to  hearing from anyone who can share the pros and cons of this trade. I  also hear differing opinions on Carpentry and in my area there aren't  many apprenticeship opportunities at the moment.Do you guys have any  suggestions about which trade, among those listed, would be a good  choice? Also, if you work in or know about a trade not listed here,  please let me know. I'm very open-minded and might not even be aware of  some options.

findapath,electrician,post,18sh711,"24M ADHD Really stuck between giving 3D modeling and art another shot or just giving up and going for trades (electrician, mechanic, HVAC)","Back when I graduated college I immediately went to community college severely broke with an absolute passion for 3D modeling for art, animation whether it was gonna be in game design, movies or even commercials. No matter how hard I tried with all my work my professors said I was being lazy and my work was really bad compared to my peers. To the point one of my professors using me as an example of what not to do and where to improve. Eventually broke down too many times from failing a math and basic English course 3 times and decided

I truly used to love 3D with a passion, I spent 3 of my 4 years in highschool taking an animation class. You couldn't rip me away and I was always looking for something new to try and make. I didn't have a PC at home so I was really excited to get FAFSA money and buy a PC to learn on and do all the cool shit I would learn in college.

Now I work for a rental company cleaning cars at 15.50hr doing 50hr weeks for the overtime money. I enjoy having a bunch of little different tasks they give me to fulfill.

 I want stuff I can do by myself but still be around other that I can provide help when needed. Work I can typically expect with the need for improvisation every so often.

I'm wrestling with the idea of booting my PC back up and retrying 3D art, modeling and animation. Trying as many new programs as possible and hoping my skills really just come back to me.

Or I've been thinking of doing a trade school for electricians since I heard union work pays well and the benefits are pretty fucking awesome. I could essentially go wherever I want with it in the country and in theory have work. 

My main concern is the long weeks I see men in my family get put through and the physical toll and risk. I'm not sure if high pay is worth 60hr weeks and dying because I accidentally touched a live wire.

findapath,electrician,comment,18sh711,,"Hi, I've worked as a 3d artist for games. I'll give what advice I can.  


Firstly, I'm sorry your college experience was crap. Reality is, almost every course and college program regarding the entertainment industry is a complete waste of money and is extremely out of date. The fact that you had to do math and english for an art program is enough of a sign that you probably fell into that trap.  


You can have a pretty lucrative career as a 3d artist, but it is competitive and takes a lot to break in. You also have to be very specific on what you want to be doing. Not only in regards to your specialization but the kinds of jobs and/or work you want to be doing. You have to tailor your portfolio to fit the position you want. As with all creative fields, you may need to get a little creative to make a living through means that don't include a steady job.

  
The first thing you need to ask yourself is whether or not you're actually passionate about it or just interested in it. People trying to break in quickly often times spend 12 or more hours a day, weekends included, honing their craft. This is who you're competing against. If you're not prepared to do the same, then 3d art might not be for you.  


But here's the thing, every other high paying ""good"" job will take a considerable amount of effort to get regardless. Think carefully and choose to pursue something you're willing to invest a lot of time into daily. Don't stress too much about getting it wrong in the case you have multiple options, you can always pivot but it's important that you keep moving forward in some direction.",1,1703732797.0,kf7txlm

Also trade pay rates very A LOT depending on where you work. Generally speaking blue states pay so much more, that tradesmen from red states travel to blue states for work. The pay I describe below is about right for the entire west coast

Apply for a trade union apprenticeship. Google “electricians union near me” “operators union in my city” “pipe fitters union in my city or state”  “elevator mechanics union near me” “glaziers union near me” however you want to word it.

All those jobs pay over 100k a year in cities and pretty well in any job market.

A union will take you on as an apprentice with zero skills, connections, ability, knowledge, or experience. Absolutely none at all, and they will get you to work with local unionized contractors. They (the contractors and other workers) will train you on the job from the ground up and their will be infrequent in class elements (through the union) to progress your training.

The barrier to joining a trade union is the same for all of them, so theirs no reason to do a lower paid trade union. Avoid the carpenter, laborers, dry wallers and painters, brick layers. Stuff like that. If your a journeyman in those unions you won’t make enough to provide for a family in today’s economy so it’s not a good enough wage.

They all offer unbeatable health insurance. A pension that is well funded, a pension is when you get paid every month after you retire, until the day you die. It’s the best form of retirement, most companies don’t offer it anymore because it cost them profit. Unions have pensions.

Their will be multiple options for career paths and apprenticeships for every union, the barrier to entry is the same so their is no incentive to pursue a lower paid path.

Electricians union. Their will be multiple programs available that are worded ambiguously. Choose the one that is the longest. It will pay the most money.

Pipe fitters unions. Includes HVAC, sprinkler fitters, plumbers (union plumbers instal on a big scale. They’re not doing house calls cleaning doo doo. But also the doo do job is one of the most important jobs in the country and the pay reflects that) , pipe fitters. Every HVAC guy I know hates his job, something about insulation I don’t know to be honest. Don’t do HVAC. Plumbers is nice because you can do handyman work on the side and make good money, but all the routes available in the pipe fitters union are well paid good options. (Except HVAC guys. They just hate their jobs… I don’t know why…)

Operators union. Can be tricky, not all pay is the same. If you learn to run more complicated or in demand equipment you’ll generally make more money. Cranes, graders, excavators, concrete pumps. Make a lot of money. Haul truck, roller. Not so much (still pretty good though).

Glaziers. Glazing is a good ass job, dudes make bank. For some reason their union seems to be tied into some lower paid trades like painting and stuff. Make sure to only apply for the glaziers route.

Elevator, escalator mechanics. Best job in the world. Only bring on new apprentices when a journeyman dies and the wait list is years long. Everyone who gets in, is a child of an elevator mechanic or has a mob or political connection. Applying is free though so who knows what will happen. No point in not applying.

Now theirs a trick to applying for an apprenticeship. For some reason the office the staff at the union hall, will guranteed. Be complete cunts to you, and also lie directly to your face and try and convince you that you cannot do the job, and also that you don’t even want the job, and that the job possibly even doesn’t even exist, their is no work available, it’s  a bad time too apply (which doesn’t make any sense at all. Waiting too apply doesn’t help you in any way whatsoever. Even if work is slow, you’ll be first on the list when it picks up and have your interview and testing process out of the way. You gain absolutely nothing from waiting to apply), that you cannot apply and your application won’t be accepted, and that it will be a bad career choice if you do. I don’t know why they do it, but for some reason they all do that to every single prospective apprentice. Just ignore them and apply to the best of your abilities, submit all the paperwork and fill out all the forms. The second tip is, they will not call you back for the next step of the process. After you apply, you need to call them and check on the process of your application and find out what the next step is and how to complete that step. Also their is a good chance your application “got lost” and you’ll need to apply again, it’s not personal they’re just cunts to everyone and it’s part of the process. It will normally be an interview or test of some kind. They will not call you and sign you up for that interview without you calling them, and they won’t warn you about that.

It’s fullfilling work, doing meaningful stuff, and generally speaking most skilled construction workers I know love their jobs. Theirs a reason why construction workers point out projects they work on, and share what they do on social media. Because we are proud of what we do and we enjoy it. Every career path I listed here makes enough money to raise a family on. Apprentices typical start out making a percentage of journeymen wage and get raises over time until they become a journeyman. It’s a program that s enforced through the state and federal government using high level lawyers and politicians. You will advance, you will make more money, you will have a good career. As long as you show up on time and don’t complain. Go union and only work union jobs for the rest of your life. Working non union is idiotic and their is no advantage of any kind. Theirs no trade offs, it’s just worse in every way.",11,1699929701.0,k95rvr8

If you find someone willing to apprentice you most chances they will help you get into a school, but you will be obligated to work for them for a time and you might not like the first guy you train under. There are a lot of miserable attitudes in trades and many of them don't really connect with generations getting into the labor force today. In order to become any of these making over $25 an hour you'd have to have been in the trade for a minimum of 4 years prior and receiving in person education as well as homework on top of waking up at 4am to go to work it's a lot to balance.

45/hour is just not gonna pay the rent and the bills where I live. 

I think the best suggestion we could give people is work any job you can get and take 10% of that money and invest it in the stock market. If you start when you're 20, you may have enough money to buy a house when you're 30.

Good investors can turn 5k into 20k in a single hour if the play the game right. 20k to 100k+ in a few minutes. You can make an entire yeear of plumber pay in a single day on the stock market, and you don't even need alot of money to start.

I started with 1k that turned to 6, that turned to 25, that turned to 150k and I've gone up every year, quit my job in law enforcement and got my realtors license for side work instead.

findapath,electrician,comment,17ukam7,,"A PLC Programmer in every job I've seen (or been in) for the last 20 years pays $20 to $30 per hour. For the PLC Programmers that make $40+ per hour; most of them are making $40 to $85 per hour --- for a 3 week project here, for a 1-week project here, for a 3-month project there, and for another project where it is 2-weeks this month, 3 more weeks two months later, and then four months later, they get another 2-weeks out of the job.    
The PLC Programmers at those rates are usually spending half of the year trying to locate freelance jobs for the other half of the year... and they usually have zero benefits.  But they sure do wear out their own vehicles and lots of airline seats.  


If you're a PLC Programmer in a single factory; that means you do all sorts of other work and then do the PLC Programming work as it arises.   Tuesday, you may be replacing a valve in a toilet. Wednesday, you may be unclogging the ice machine in the breakroom -- where you see all the nasty slime and goo that clogs those things -- at least you learn to never use the ice machine again.   And then a PLC Programming job comes up...   Your assignment: add a new step in the middle of this machine cycle to make two more checks for components that have been added by an updated product design.  It takes you 10 minutes to get your laptop; connect to the network, connect to the machine's PLC.  You sift through the program, noticing undocumented (unlabeled) changes that someone else made to the program without saving the latest version to the network -- and they all deny being the culprit.  Anyway, you first figure out what they added and you update the logic with labels and notes.  Then, a manager comes by and asks, ""Are you done yet?""  What?  I haven't been given the details of what I'm adding, I was just making sure I had the current program so that I could review it and be ready to start the update.   The non-programmer manager and/or supervisor:  ""All you have to do is add this, this, and this and then slap another line in the program, right?""    That means you now have to walk away so production can keep running and then you are called to an ""emergency"" breakdown in another department --- it might be a PLC thing, it might be an electrical problem, it might be a hydraulic problem, it might be the case where nothing no longer works because the parts being loaded into a machine have some change that no one communicated and then another machine has to be adjusted and modified right there, right then, on the fly --- mechanically, electrically, and logically (plc code).    So, you spend the rest of the workday confirming that they want this machine update or find out that the part was or wasn't supposed to be changed... then you update this 2nd machine.    The first machine needs to be done by tomorrow because they just told you about the new deadline since all you got to do is ""type: tap tap tap, tap-tap, tap-tap-tap tap and click"" and abra-cadabra, it's DONE!    The reality is that you can't ""think"" to develop a program modification because the plant is incredibly noisy, the bosses are non-stop ""noisy"", and you're going on 16 hours today.

In most cases, you're developing new PLC code for this update at home, on your time, for free.  You get your best ideas in the shower and then you wake up with great ideas too.   (Ok, all types of writers get ideas like that).  But you're doing hours and hours of work at home, working for free.

Yeah, not ALL PLC jobs are like this, but most of them are definitely like this. Your bosses, managers, and owners don't understand what PLC Programming is and if you have to design a new machine, or a major overhaul of an existing one, they don't understand the time involved -- and they don't understand that you can't always come up with something in a flash while in the middle of a factory with a thousand different things clanging in your ears.  Even when you do it at work, you're pulled away every five minutes to do something else. 

18 years as a PLC and Robot Programmer in an automotive supplier facility...   I'll never again do any work for free.  At first, I accepted it as ""free training"" as there is always something to learn... but it got out of hand.   And it wasn't just the programming; I was working 70 to 80 hours per week anyway, for more than 10 of those 18 years.   New owners/new management cut out the PLC jobs on 2nd and 3rd (I was on 2nd, the 3rd shift guy was new and just went back to his previous job in another department... he thought he was going to be ""sitting around playing on a laptop all day"").  There were two on 1st.  They were put on salary; one bailed right then. The other stayed since he was near retirement.     


I was hourly, earning a six-figure income due to the massive amount of overtime.   First I was going to be put on salary or the awesome annual total of $33,000.  I laughed.  Then they were going to demote me and put me in another department...  starting at the lowest wage in the plant $16.50.  I never gave an answer of which I chose... because they decided that they'd just kick me to the curb.   12 people already had job leads and bailed.  8 of us were kicked to the curb all on the same day.  :)",1,1699972831.0,k97t577

Over 10 years or more, this is what they told me every time I walked in the door.   Now, they (and everyone else) say that is NEVER how they operated.  Uh, yes, it was how they operated.

I went to school to get a trade but I screwed up by going to school for electronics...   I had no money; could not get a student loan because my parents (father) would provide tax info or a signature for that sort of thing.   Yeah, this is pre-Internet, etc.   But he would assist me in going to an electronics school... they are out of business now; you might guess who they are.   After two months in, you're committed to 100% of the tuition. I tried to talk to my dad about problems with the school... he just screamed at me, ""you don't appreciate anything""... the 2-month mark came, so I was stuck paying 100% whether I finished or not.   I finished.  


Learned about:  
DC Voltage, Electron/Hole Flow, Dry cell batteries, Digital logic (most of the course's focus): 7400 series ICs - logic gates, transistor (as a switch), resistor, capacitor (never used one in a circuit), switches, diodes, LEDs.  
We built little circuits on a ""protoboard"" -- not a wire-wrap thing they kept talking about... just a protoboard or project board where we plugged in components and built circuits with jumper wires.  


We soldered ONE DAY -- we soldered ends on a piece of coaxial cable to use it as an oscilloscope probe, instead of using a proper one.  We used the scope during ONE DAY... all we had to measure was a DC voltage from our fixed power supply which had 12 & 5VDC.  The only ones who were able to display an AC wave were those who stuck the lead into the 110V receptable on the workbench.  That was the only time we ever saw a scope in 2 years.  
We never once saw a circuit board.

findapath,electrician,comment,17ukam7,,"So this list is….. mostly accurate, but what you’re forgetting to tell people? Is that you won’t make even the lowest amount listed above after taking the time to learn the skill in the first place. You have to apprentice first and there are levels of apprenticeship involved, in most cases. All apprentices make a fraction of the money they should or would otherwise. Not even enough to live on more or less keep your equipment up to date. 

To even attend the trade school? You have to first be able to afford the cost of the trade school and afford the up to 5000 dollar set of tools and protective gear that are only just the most basic of gear, because you’ll need it just to participate in classes the first place. 

And even though trade school takes between 4 months and two years? YOU STILL HAVE TO APPRENTICE FOR UP TO 6 years. The entire time paying your own way on less than minimum wage because you’re still apprenticing. 

Trade school is an excellent alternative, but all around it takes just as long and is almost just as expensive as attending a 4 year university for your bachelors. 

I’m all for trade school. If you make it through you have a guaranteed income unlike a four year degree from whatever college, but it’s not ultimately cheaper. And in some cases it’s more difficult than just going to college.

findapath,electrician,comment,17ukam7,,"What you call fake nice the rest of us call “manners and civility”

But sure keep going because I’ve worked both types of jobs and I can tell you blue collar jobs are far more cutthroat.

White collar jobs come with a contract or a salary..

So you get paid the same for 35hrs as for 40.

Also why are you being evil for a leg up when everyone here works on contract so if you want a leg up you need to “build out” your resume.

You don’t get more by undercutting you get more by expanding what you can provide to the company.

(Aka more education or general certs get you pay bumps)

So yeah.. I think you should quit Blue collar and try White collar.

You’d be pleasantly surprised not just by people acting fake nice… but by probably meeting some really nice people.

And to be clear there are great people in trades but trades has a way of taking advantage of a person and (sometimes) they can kill a persons body/spirit along the way.

Trades people are often jaded and think “good work ethic” = good pay but that’s often not the case.

To get good pay you either had to (go back to school or get a general cert… recognize something here from earlier?)

Or you had to be born into it like a nepo baby..

There is no such thing as a good paying (low skill low education) blue collar job.

Every single high paying blue collar job might as well say it takes college…

You can’t be master electrician without the certs, master welder (golden arms?) Same thing.. 

You can’t even be a top plumber without school and most of those guys who are able to read the blueprints go to contractor schools.

So sure you can work your way up from the bottom BUT at some point school or certs will be in your way so just like white collar workers..

In the mill, insults and threats flew thick.  I've had to bust up fights and restrain coworkers before.  If you bent over for anything, you could expect to have your oil checked.  At retirement or the day before your wedding, you could expect to have your pants cut off and be painted with something like Prussian blue.  Someone would attempt to drown you with a water hose or a bucket of water regularly.  

But if you had something personal going on, no one would hesitate to step in and cover you while you took care of it.  I could have called any of those assholes at 3 in the morning, and they would have showed up to pull me out of whatever mess I was in with a smile and an insult.  If something at work went off the rails, you didn't have to ask for help, 3 or 4 folks would immediately show up and pitch in, all the while giving you grief for having to do your job while laughing.  It was one big dysfunctional family, and everyone pulled their weight.  In 2 decades, I never had a single day that I dreaded going to work.

You've got to have a relatively thick skin to work somewhere like that, but if you do, you'll enjoy every day.  I'm actively looking to get back to that environment, because the lack of trust and camaraderie on the other side stresses me out to the point that I despise leaving the house for work now.

findapath,electrician,comment,17ukam7,,"Embedded stuff is pretty useful just for knowing some basic wiring and programming real objects. My path was, and it's not necessarily typical, was I did get a 4 year degree in comp sci but was a little bit naive in what the job market would be like and didn't specialize myself fresh out of college in May 2020. Bad timing and didn't prepare myself to be great candidate in SWE. I wound up just getting a job as an operator in the meantime so I could readjust. I used Udemy to take some PLC courses, which was pretty different programming than what I was used to but the fundamentals were there. Probably the same for you if you can do some arduino. I worked hard and showed aptitude in my operator job, let people know what I was doing, and was lucky enough that my plant needed more programming help in less than a year of hire. I held an Electrical engineering title despite not really knowing much about wiring and hardware before learning a lot on the job. One thing about it is you need to be able to adapt quickly because nobody can know everything and you earn your keep when nobody has a clue what's going on. I recently moved and now have a more accurate Controls Engineer title for a system integrator, which can give a lot of experience really fast. 

In short my advice is get yourself in an industry, show initiative on your own time, go the extra mile and earn respect. Don't listen to the idiots that tell you to the bare minimum that's the worst career advice in the world. You'll make that money back with the doors you open for yourself. Manufacturing in general will provide a lot of great career paths and you can get out what you put into it. They will train people.

I hire for fit and aptitude, not current skillset.  I will hire an inexperienced kid who really wants the job and is eager to learn and grow over someone with experience who just fills a spot.

So quit working overtime and stop acting like it’s a badge of honor.

No sir,

A badge of honor is having the time to make ends meet while NEVER becoming an empty seat at a Christmas play, soccer game, life event/etc.

A badge of honor would/should be working less for your boss and giving more (time) to your family.

OT is never a good thing for anyone but your boss.. No matter what they paid you to finish contracts early they still made bank off the back of your time/labor/and your ass..

So if they can afford to pay OT and still make profit… That shows you all you (should) need to see.

Math people know this so do the math and stop gifting away your life for money..

findapath,electrician,comment,17ukam7,,">all govt jobs are unionized

I can tell you from experience that this is untrue.

>that’s the only way they can get away with paying so little

First off, yes, government jobs almost always pay less than equivalent work in the private sector. However, I still make a solid wage at $76,440 a year ($36.75 if calculated hourly). And, that comes with excellent benefits that most private companies couldn't, or wouldn't, provide, unionized or not, and a great work-life balance. 

If I were to calculate the value of my benefits only, excluding the intangible value of work-life balance, alongside my pay, I likely make close to as much as, or more than, someone in an equivalent position in the private industry. Hell, the value of my employer's portion of my health insurance is $12,000 a year (80% of the premium, I pay the other 20%). The rest of my benefits easily put me close to or over the $100,000 mark.

Also, it's precisely because of my union that I have such a great compensation package. You'd have to pay me A LOT, like we're talking double my current salary at minimum, to get me to even consider moving to the private sector because there's no way the benefits would be as good as I currently have.

Instead, your life is sitting alone for hours on end. Maybe you go out occasionally but if you're living off of just social security you can't afford it.

findapath,electrician,post,18ugabr,Does anybody disagree that the trades is one of the greatest wealth hacks people sleep on?,"The trades are among the greatest wealth cheat codes people sleep on!

I wanted to add a reply to someone who just said job hopping is the greatest wealth cheat. I'm going to say trades are among the greatest wealth cheat codes people sleep on.

Aviation mechanics, plumbers, electrician, HVAC attendants, elevator mechanics, truckers, etc. are the greatest jobs people sleep on. Many people look at a trucker or a plumber and think they didn't go to a university so they're not on the level of many professionals. These mechanics could open up businesses, get paid tons of money as journeymen, they're recession proof, and if they're smart with their money they could become millionaires.

People who think truckers can't become millionaires they may not be higher income but in NJ, NY, CA, if you work for Walmart, you can make >100k. You can live in your truck. Your job is recession proof. Same with mechanics, aviation mechanics, journeymen (who make usually 40-50/hr), linesmen, elevator repairmen.

I remember reading engineers normally start at 70k maybe 90k depending on the state. They get paid salary. The electrician journeymen make 40-50/hr and there's always overtime especially if you work for the state. You can make well over 150k I've read some journeymen make over 200k with all the overtime.

No schooling needed but trade school helps. They accept convicted felons. They are recession proof.

I know it's hard work but for the guys who smart with their money and invest into real estate or stocks they can pretty soon open their own business and help out new apprentices and work much less while collecting rent or dividends or selling appreciated stocks.

findapath,electrician,comment,18ugabr,,"I disagree but mostly because of where I live and my experience with the trades. 

I live in a mid size city in the Canadian prairies and the culture here is very rural, working class and trades oriented despite being a city of close to 1m people. I have to laugh every time I see posts like “end the stigma against trades! Teach your kids it’s ok to be a plumber! etc etc” because here it is the exact opposite. People with “honest” jobs are celebrated and Lawyers, Doctors, Accountants get a lot of distrust and are seen as elites trying to swindle the Everyman out of his hard earned money. 

Then there’s the “trades are in demand and you’ll make great money!” Side of it. Again that seems very different here based on my (admittedly anecdotal) experience. The common ticketed trades (electrician, hvac, etc) are almost impossible to get into because everyone and their dog wants to be an electrician and the entry level job market is saturated with apprentice hopefuls. You need an in. Also the level 1 and level 2 rates are embarrassingly low - barely more than minimum wage. You can make more money bartending or waiting tables and I think many young people avoid the trades because they can’t afford to make so little money while pursuing their journeyman. The real money is in being a business owner / self employed but it’s such a stressful and hard life, people work themselves into an early grave trying to compete as self employed tradespeople. 

Thirdly the culture is a problem imo. The older experienced guys whose job it is to train the next generation are often miserable jaded pricks. Toxic work culture is the name of the game. Also right wing politics are dominant and if you have left of centre views on just about anything you won’t succeed on certain crews. This isn’t a hard rule obviously but there’s a lot of it where I’m from. 

So that’s my take. I went to college for welding as a young adult and despite enjoying the work and being pretty good at it I couldn’t find a job that was a good fit for me. Interviewed and got offers for a couple jobs but didn’t have a good feeling about either and they both paid significantly less than I was making as a middle manager at my service industry job.",2,1703955757.0,kfkpith

Further, they do essential work for our society to function. They also do the jobs most other people do not want to do or cannot do because they’re so physically demanding. 

I tried the trades and couldn’t hack it. Worked for my dad at his tax office in the offseason and went back to school for accounting.

Many tradesman earn 60-80k so they aren’t poor. But they risk their lives for that money. 

I’ve done many tradesman’s taxes so I’ve seen what they make. IMO they are massively underpaid.

Further, I got offered a position as an accountant out of school and I will start at what a journeyman bricklayer/mason tops out at. 

Here’s my honest opinion on the trades, they are a better path financially for many people. Especially for people who prefer to work with their hands compared to working on a computer. You don’t need to worry about getting arrested because it won’t ruin your career, and if you come to America and have few options, the trades will afford you a middle class lifestyle.

I also think this is wrong though.  I know plenty of people who lost their businesses and their jobs during down turns.  It happens same as everything else.

It's also not great as far as the cost goes.  You save on tuition but you also need to do a pretty hard apprenticeship and pay some tuition to get certifications or go to trade school which can cost a lot depending on where you are.  

It's also just way more dangerous than an office job and harder on your body.  So you'd need to include that as part of the calculation.  Also the ""good ol boy"" culture that basically just amounts to abuse of new people and poor safety culture.

findapath,electrician,comment,18ugabr,,"I was taught this as a teenager and tried to follow this advice. From my experience: 

It won't make you rich, but if everything breaks your way, it can make you comfortable. In many people's cases, especially the most poor of us, it rarely works out. 

My experience: so in high school I went to a program dedicated to getting kids into the trades. It was literally called ""Construction Trades"" and it taught you all about the apprenticeship standards in my state and gave you introductions to a variety of basic trades, like carpentry and welding. I did well in the program, enjoyed it greatly, star student, ect ect. 

Then came time to actually get into a trade. The top three I was interested in automatically rejected me because I would either have to move to where the jobs/apprenticeships were (I had no way to do that) or I had to have reliable transportation to get to job sites when they wanted me to (I didn't get a car until I was 19, and I was the first in my immediate family to have one in over a decade). Pretty much every other option either had physical demands I couldn't meet, I hated the work, or you had to know someone to get in. Nepotism is strong in the trades and many don't realize it. 

So after inadvertently taking a gap year trying to find something, I decided to attend a college program that was essentially an apprenticeship to get you into being a CNC machinist. You know those 3d printers? Those, but cutting materials instead of printing them, and often much bigger. 

This actually panned out somewhat; between finally getting a car with fast food job money, my previous carpentry training in high school and my new CNC training, I ended up working in a custom cabinetry business, cutting out the pieces to be built into the cabinets from huge sheets of material. Mostly various flavors of MDF, particle board and plywood, but occasionally actual wood. The hours were brutal, the work was physically difficult and mind numbing, the pay was not good, no benefits. I was eventually fired because my ""work quality was decreasing"". My entire family had been evicted and I was sleeping on a hardwood floor in an uninsulated room in winter. 

What I learned: trades are largely still run by boomers and rife with nepotism. If you can ""tough it out"" and ""earn it"" or are born into a trade family, then yeah it can pan out. Being a master in any skill, trade or non, is always lucrative. For the rest of us, you basically just spend several years doing rediculous amounts of physical damage to your body for a pittance and hoping someday your ship will come in. 

Today I've washed up working for my state government doing workers compensation claims. It sucks but it's an ok paycheck and a pension with enough years left to build it up ok, so whatever.

findapath,electrician,comment,18ugabr,,"The place to start with this is to read 'The Millionaire Next Door'. The point of this is that a lot of people have high incomes that do 'scut work': plumbing, diesel mechanic, junk yard, and so forth. These roles change over time, so what was true in the 1970's when the book was written may not be true now. However, the rest of the point is as follows:

'High Prestige' roles such as Lawyer or Doctor sometimes force these practitioners not only into higher spending (houses, luxury cars, etc.) but also into debt. The corporate lawyer makes $500K but lives in a $5 million house, which may have a $3 million mortgage. This house (and the associated neighborhood driven spending) is not optional: his/her clients will not continue to do business if they aren't wined and dined, can't sleep over in a 'nice neighborhood' on short notice out-of-town business trips, and so forth. The income is associated with certain mandatory expectations.

Plumbers, on the other hand, work for anyone that has pipes, which is basically everyone. They drive a van with a RotoRooter hanging out the back. They aren't invited to live in the 'high network individual' neighborhoods. Their kids aren't expected to go to private schools. Therefore, they fly under the radar.

The IRS says that there are about 23 million millionaires in the US, and the Census Bureau says there are about 130 million households in the US. 130/23 = 5.6, so somewhere between 1 in 5 and 1 in 6 households have 'millionaire' level wealth. This number can vary from week to week depending on the stock market.

The 'average' net worth of a US household is now over $1 million, per the US Federal Reserve. Of course, you can drown in a river that is, on average, only six inches deep. What this suggests is that in opposition to the 107 million households worth less than 1 million, 2.3 million households are worth $10 million+, $100 million+, or in the $billions.",1,1703959663.0,kfl03nx

findapath,electrician,comment,18ugabr,,"Dude you are cherry picking data. The bureau of labor states the average salary for a plumber is 60k or a bit under. That is not wealth and unless you are single for most of your life and live plainly you are not going to be investing in real estate and the stock market except for maybe some small positions using etrade.  

You say most engineers start at 70-90k depending on the state but use California salary for truckers making 100k. In SF bay area a single mom of two needs to make Around 60k to be above the poverty line. 100k there is a dismal salary. We start engineers (good ones) at more than 150k. That will include equity, if in office it’ll be typically two free catered meals a day. Equity can bring life changing wealth. I made 10 million off my first IPO and that was being an early employee and working a lot and no vacation. 

That was for 4 years I bet few plumbers, truck drivers, electricians make 10 mil over their lifetime. And the ones they do are top of their field. I don’t sleep in my truck as you stated when I travel for work I stay in 5 star hotels now.

Avg electrician salaries according to a trade site Workwave
Journeyman electrian ($43,113 – $71,200)
Master ($48,411 – $90,882)

You’ve made the mistake a lot of people make. They excitedly cherry pick stats and think wow 100k? Fuck that is big money. In California where you mentioned that is not great unless you are single and frugal. You won’t be buying a house there let alone investing in real estate. 

200k for a journeyman is for a VERY rare breed with a degree. Not a convict who changed his ways or the average person. Highly driven superior people with a reputation and luck.

Making that much within the trades is possible, but the way to get there is to rely on your body to perform hard physical labor, day in and day out, 70 hours six days a week, for 25 years in a row.

This idea that it’s a hack to wealth… it takes just as much time as a college degree to get to the point where you are making as much money as someone with a corporate job. Then you have to be smart with your money, and you have to be one of the tradesmen moving up in their careers. It takes a lot of hard work to become wealthy as a tradesman.

You can make good money in trades and if you don’t your area either sucks and is down south more than likely so either move up north or different career.

If we look at it from a pragmatic perspective of - 

Trade worker: starts at 19, Goes in making 60k, ends up at 80k for the rest of their career (these are pretty conservative estimates, but depends on the field) 

College degree: Start working at 22 with 40k in debt, goes into career making 50k, but ends up at 150k. 

The time value of the trade worker will be higher than the college degree worker and if both sides are live frugally and invest heavily. Odds are, the trade worker can probably retire much sooner. If you plan to retire at 65, your dollar value is 97x at 19 but it’s only 66x at 22.

Once I hit second year my wife was added to my insurance and also began accruing pension contributions. Each year I had pay increases, and being cheap labor I stayed employed for the vast majority of the time I was an apprentice. Spent a total of 3 weeks laid off as an apprentice and 2 weeks as a journeyman. I eventually transitioned to the power sector. Still use my trade knowledge, but am no longer busting ass in the heat and humidity pulling cable, building conduit runs, installing cable tray, digging, etc. However, without that experience I wouldn't have the job I have now. So in my case it worked out tremendously, I also began my electrical career at 30. 

Just made sure I was always on time to work, had my tools, learned as much as possible and experience as much as possible and it paid off. I got a diverse experience from digging trenches for underground feeders, backup generators for assisted living facilities, controls and instrumentation in dairy plants, phosphate mines, chemical plants, motor controls for sauce a dale sauce plant, worked at universities, power plants, and in all sorts of heat, humidity, and weather conditions. 

Most of my classmates didn't finish, but the ones who did are all doing well.

I've gotten to work on huge ass drag lines at the phosphate mines that run on 7200v, big 4160v pumps motors, would perform pit moves for phosphate mining. This involved racking out giant ass breakers and disconnects, re-routing cable, re terminating and verifying rotation, commissioning VFD sleds, I got to build out a control cabinet for a prototype sled used for phosphate mining, got to build the conduit runs and terminate all of the soft start and plc controls for production lines.

I was making about 32/hr on the check in the Tampa area when I worked out of the hall. If I wanted to travel like some of my classmates, sure there's money in the 50+/hr range out there. Some locals have amazing benefits packages. Unfortunately in the south the wages and benefits aren't nearly as good, but it's a livable wage. A union inside wireman is going to making at median or above household income for Florida by themselves, so if your spouse works, it's not so bad. Honestly for the longest my wife was working at either a small office or the SPCA and we made it work, things got easier once I became a journeyman. 

I personally didn't want to travel, so I left the construction side and went to a power plant. There's upsides and downsides to both. Upside is more stability and higher pay, downsides are rotating shift schedule and less flexibility in the sense you work directly for the utility. As a union wireman you can drag up jobs at any point to go to another job, just as a contractor is free to lay you off at any given time.

During outages there tends to be overtime or when there's a lot of people taking vacation. This year I chased the money and worked a bunch of overtime. Next year,  I'm trying to work as little overtime as possible. 

Overall I've got it good with my current job. It's very laid back, pays well, decent benefits, plus there is a pension on top of the 401k we contribute into.

We pulled 350s into an ats and generator in the pouring rain for 5 hours straight. Then sat in a hot ass electrical room terminating and outside at the ATS. Then getting rained on again the rest of the day as we cleaned up the work area, waiting for an inspector, etc. It was a shit show. Spent 19 hours in a drag line de-terming the transformer conductors and pulling them out, while welders were cutting a giant hole in the wall, this was during the summer and there was zero moving air in that bitch. After we removed our stuff, yes we sat around on stand by until the unit could be craned out and a new one put in. When your in oppressive levels of heat and humidity even if you're not doing anything, it wears you out. I've worked in attic spaces above boiler rooms that had to be 130° running conduit with just enough space to crawl or sit indian style. My first job ever was at the airport on a wire pulling crew. I thought I was gonna die lol, I was so out of shape and got heat exhaustion quite a few times. You're working out in the sun around bright ass cable tray on bright concrete next to an landing and take off strip. It was so god damn hot. Everyone thought I was going to quit lol and the thought crossed my mind, but as I got acclimated it got better but still that heat is no joke. The simplest tasks are brutal when you're soaked in sweat from briefs to jeans and shirt and you can't dry off because the humidity is so high, you can barely drink enough fluids and eventually just water isn't enough. Pair that with the only shade available is under the hot ass concrete platform for the tram. 

We were pulling multiconductor 500s with 4/0 ground copper, by hand, that shit is 5lbs a foot. When you've got 12 people and you're pulling hundreds of feet at a time, that gets to be extremely tiresome. Our contractor was a bunch of cheap fucks who didn't want to invest in tuggers, rollers, sheaves, and pulleys to aid in pulls. 

I certainly had easy days out at the mines working in a 4x4 service truck chilling and watching movies, but that was after I had paid my dues lol. It was a lot of hard work. There were long days, class, homework, exams, and craft certifications and commutes could be anywhere from right up the road to 130 miles away. 

My job now? I might work an hour a day. Some days it's balls to the wall, but 99% of the time it's do your rounds, inspections, works orders, and sit back. I mean I took a 6 hour nap last night. We are watching the Dallas v Lions game in the control room now lol.",1,1703985863.0,kfmx5sb

Now we only do it on the units that are cycled off for safety reasons and to not risk tripping a unit.

findapath,electrician,comment,17wg9q0,,"I entered the restaurant industry around 2008. I've worked as a dishwasher, bus boy, cook and server since then sometimes having 2 full-time service jobs at once. I've also worked retail, sales and IT.

Being a server has been, by far, the easiest job I've ever had. By magnitudes the least stressful. Can it be hectic? yes. Can it be frustrating? yes. Can people eating there drive you crazy with their attitude? yes. But by no means is it difficult once you learn your menu and culture for the restaurant. The only hard part is the hours, in my opinion. 

Management can be toxic or good anywhere. Clients/customers can be awful anywhere. Substance abuse is a choice one makes at any job and ive known of more coworkers doing coke in the office than any restaurant. Turnover is high because the job is easy. People know they can get a new job in the industry by end of day.

A 6 figure salary may be seasonal, but at the end of the year your W-2 is still 6 figures. It doesn't matter what time of the year you earn the bulk of it so long as you earn it.

I will say that right now you can earn pretty good money as a copywriter that trains AI. You answer prompts, fact check, make sure AI is responding to the prompt appropriately. 

Also, if you do copywriting, many people will use AI and then have you edit it, which is faster and easier than writing it yourself. I think there's going to continue to be a fair amount of jobs for writers, it's just going to look very different than it has in the past. 

And you really don't need any special training to be a writer. Just write well and be prepared to prove it. Education certainly helps, though.

It can use the I as a part of speech but it will never have the I essence. 

If we look back in human history lot of things got simpler just because of tools. Lets take an example of art since that is the area which got affected the most. In the past people used to draw pictures in caves. Abstract yet definite. Then paintings. Then different media related to art. Then advent of computers. Then software to help create digital art. More advanced tools in the software. Now AI is generating art. If you look at the aI art today, (Atleast I feel this way) its sort of repetitive , monotonous and lacks taste. It is lacking that feeling of humanness. Its not as appreciated as the creative endevours of past. So for AI correct prompts are still necessary to create magnificense. Its just that creative display is shown in a different area. AI for now is a very efficient tool. Thats all.   

Just dont worry. More repetitive, effort intensive tasks only will be done by AI. It is not true intelligence as the name suggests.

findapath,electrician,comment,1bb0925,,"I’m willing to share some stories, but I really must reiterate that this isn’t a field you want to go into. The turnover rate for these jobs is insanely high for a reason. 


I worked for a nonprofit residential treatment and foster care facility. It was lauded by the community for its work within the community, but the administration was insanely corrupt. Half of our funding went to bonuses for the “inner circle,” of administrators, old ladies that had been there for 10 years in the office. This caused us to go without critical resources (LIKE FOOD) a good many times.


We had several buildings on our property that housed clients. When I started, 3 were classed as level 4, the highest a non-clinical setting can be classed. 2 of those facilities were locked; that means every single door had a lock with the exception of the bathrooms for clients and their bedroom doors.


During my time in the first building I worked in, the all-boys building, I was stabbed twice in the abdomen. The first time penetrated almost an inch. The second time didn’t go as deep because the kid who stabbed me had sweaty hands from engaging us in hand-to-hand combat for 45 minutes prior.  We were not allowed to do anything except physical restraints (with nurse and supervisor present) so a lot of days boiled down to us literally running from our lives until a supervisor could be located, which was hard because the other locked building was just as busy. I got moved from that building because it closed due to a lawsuit.

In the interim, my coworker’s throat was slit on Christmas Eve. When we finally got her off the floor and a cop in the building, the client that slit my coworker’s throat managed to wrestle the cop with the help of another client and was able to unholster and discharge his weapon into the floor. They, of course, went to jail, but the fallout of this incident directly impacted everyone who was present for this for a long time. A lot of those clients were quietly transferred to new facilities.


Later, I was assigned to a lower level of care. This is usually less stress, but thanks to the oversights of our corrupt administration and a corrupt local government, we received 2 kids who did not meet the criteria for level 3, but were placed in our care anyway. One, a boy I’ll call A, was so incredibly violent that he shattered the skull of my coworker with a heavy chair. He also totaled the car parked next to mine with a cinder block. He caused over $100,000 of property damage during his 2 months there, at a time where I was the only adult in charge of 4 teenagers because all of my coworkers had quit. I worked with this group for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 2 months straight. I received a cardstock award and a $15 Amazon gift card as compensation. My time with A nearly ruined my relationship with my wife, as I came home insanely late and had nearly no desire to be intimate. Luckily, we worked together at the time so she knew what I was going through.


Near the end of my tenure, I participated in an improper restraint that should have been called off or I should not have participated in. A rather large kid with low-functioning autism targeted me. Long story short, we had to restrain him, but due to his size (he was over 6ft tall and was rather fit) I had to hold his legs. Being that he was quite strong, he slammed me against the ground repeatedly. Unfortunately, thanks to the fact that most people who sign up to be mental health counselors are feminine in muscular structure, I had no one I could swap with. So I ended the encounter with a hairline fracture in one of my neck vertebrae that required extensive recovery. My facility never filed the workers comp forms as the HR lady quit that morning. I spent over 2 years fighting them and the hospital to have that covered until I finally said “fuck y’all it’s up to you,” and stopped answering the calls from the medical debtors.


I have a LOT of stories of heartache and grief, watching these horribly abused and unwell kids behave in ways that reflected their individual situations. I spent many many hours holding the bloodied hands of kids that slit their wrists while we waited for ambulances to arrive. I have cried with clients after phone calls with their case workers telling them that their parents weren’t coming to see them for the 6th consecutive month. I have more stories that I’m unwilling to recall and reflect upon because of how much pain they still cause me. I will never EVER promote this line of work to anyone.

After all, we have had similar situations in the past: There was, for example, the industrial revolution. Some time later, with quite a bit of engineering to produce smarter machinery, lots of skilled weavers lost their jobs.

All of a sudden, textiles also became much cheaper, and much more affordable for everyone.

Was that a good thing, or not?

Of course factory owners earned themselves a golden nose through the exploitation of their workforce.

In response to all of that, along came a guy called Marx, who pointed out some of the problems which this development has caused, and some possible solutions on how to tackle it. It's not my fault that socialism in its many forms is underappreciated nowadays. Solutions to associated problems exist.

So, the idea that AI, or an increase in productivity, is not good, is what I would call laughable at best.

Ahhh removal of damaged nerves is root canal treatment. Yes, it takes approximately 8 years to become a dentist (4 undergrad + 4 dental school unless you finish your undergrad courses in less time). As a dentist you can do pretty much any procedure you are comfortable with but you can specialize afterwards. You can specialize in root canals (endodontics). Also, specialists are paid/reimbursed more as well. So say a general dentist and an endodontist both do the same procedure on the same tooth. The endodontist will make more since he has a specialty certification. To become an endodontist, it is an extra 3 years of schooling. oral surgery (OMFS) is 6 extra years lol.

We really are not making booku bucks. Like I said, I'm debt free (thank God) so I can choose to only work 3 days a week and take home a decent pay (also not married, no GF, no children, and live at home).

If I could do it all over, I might have attempted some type of engineering because I like creating/building. My one hobby is woodworking and I want to get into metalworking and welding as well.

What kept me from going the engineering route was the high-level math courses required for the degree. I did not want to start and then fail out or not be able to finish the degree and then start all over again. 

Good question to ask. Really research what you want to do. I did my research, but I really didn't find out I disliked dentistry until I started working after school.

In elementary school, that equates to a gap in those who know their alphabets, those who can read a level one book. If they make it to college, that equates to adults who don’t know how to do anything for themselves educationally, because they were simply moved through the grades after graded on presence, but ultimately and intrinsically failed by the people who were “supposed” to have taught them. 

Ai can’t teach what parents won’t, and what teachers aren’t there to instill.

Starting a biz, if you validate the market in your area, would be killer and not that much of a gamble if you're competent with some of the other pieces and have good self discipline. People in the other boat, working white collar and hating it, would kill to have the skills you have as an electrician I think. 

You'd have to learn those skills making a blue collar transition anyways. Might as well make yourself rich sooner vs waiting 5+ in a career transition that might never even materialize. Also don't underestimate how much you'd potentially hate the physical impact of white collar work.

I don't know the barriers to entry but solar or ev charger installation sounds great. My advice, for ANYBODY starting a biz, is to side hustle even if it breaks you for a bit. Spend six months validating and trying to make sales, acquiring gear, and try to get enough consistent income to at least survive on. Then quit your job and step on the gas once you know your sales and installation pipeline works. Start hiring other folks to do the work itself and you'll be doing well very soon.

If there's a non-compete locking you down, have a chat to your boss. In my experience, businessmen are more open to help other businessmen than you think.  


Start small, just yourself or maybe take a small cut in your current salary and living means to hire a junior.

The constant influx of more and more people able and willing to do jobs means more competition between candidates (and therefore higher requirements like education and experience) while a lot of them end up unemployed or underpaid because they have no other options.

Yes there are other factors too but the heart of it is really we just have too many people now and not enough jobs. We have an oversupply of workers.

For example imagine the amount of jobs stayed the same but we had half the amount of people available to fill those jobs - we would have the opposite happening. People who are underqualified will get hired for jobs simply because they need someone to fill that role, and on the flip side the employers will now be competing against each other with wages to try and recruit the most/best from the limited pool of available workers.

findapath,electrician,comment,171nhbl,,"There's typically two entrances when becoming an electrician.

1. Contact IBEW/any electrician entity in your area and ask if you can join and do an apprenticeship and the process of joining. Trades in general are high in demand with less people going into and even if you don't have the experience now, they'll typically give you a nice roadmap on how to get into it from nothing. My cousin got an apprenticeship after contacting IBEW in his area, they told him he needed a license in the state of CA, and he got it, did an interview with IBEW, and got an apprenticeship. 

2. Go to a trade school first and look for a job during/after. Trade school is cheap relative to actual college and usually a lesser courseload so you have time to work a job while schooling.

One last thing to note and this isn't really about electricians but any jobs in general, disregard job postings because those that make the job posting doesn't understand the actual job. 

Any place that says they require 2-3 years of experience for an entry level is either a fake listing, a bad company trying to get a cheap hire, or an HR company that just copy and paste buzzwords and what sounds good.",2,1696657530.0,k3ti2ww

The program was sponsored by these guys https://sepatec.org which is where I would start looking into if you want this.
 
Being a service tech you will be working outside 95% of your day and sometimes you might have to crawl under houses…so if you are prepared for that then it might be something for you! Being a bobtail delivery driver only took 2 weeks for the course but you also have to get a CDL B through DMV and your tanker and more important hazmat endorsement, which you’ll have to go to another class for, but that only was one day. The propane school will help you with all this though if you are serious. You’ll be working with blue collar dudes so it may be a culture shock. I mean, I grew up in the south and around blue collar guys, but I never really worked in blue collar environments before without my dad, and mostly did office jobs before. So you might work alongside some oldtimers that can be assholes at times or lack a lot of patience for newcomers.

The skills for these roles aren’t taught in college, so learning on the job is pretty common. There are also certificates and a lot of free resources to learn advertising.

findapath,electrician,comment,16zjray,,"Hi there. Here's a few ideas for you:

I would strongly consider getting a degree somehow. There are remote colleges which may be more your speed. I'm currently enrolled at WGU and it's 100% online, go at your own pace. Your mileage may vary but I'd say it's far more affordable than most other college options.

The reason I strongly suggest this is because it is getting increasingly difficult to find work without a degree. It's not impossible by any means, and in some industries there's *less* emphasis being put on it... but in general, it's tough. I'm 40 and even though I have a really good paying job as a Sr. Sales Director, I'm going back to school to further my education because I am seeing more and more opportunities pass me by due to my lack of formal education. You may be lucky like me and find a really good gig with a company that doesn't care... but if you ever want/need/are forced to look for another job, it'll be tough.

That said.... 

* Remote customer service / tech support: These generally don't require degrees and can be fairly decent-paying. Tech support may require some experience/training/certification based on the gig.
   * Obviously this is ""having to deal with people"" but if you're doing it remote you can probably avoid direct interaction and only interact via email/support ticket and/or live chat.  
* Sales: Sales is one of the few jobs where you can make a lot of money but you don't *need* a degree to do it. 
   * Of course, the downside is sales is very interactive. You HAVE to deal with people, and typically face to face or at least via phone/zoom. 
* Data entry/analytics: Possible to break in at the entry level without any training or degree, though it would help. 
* Programming/Coding: Generally a 4-year degree is not required, but you'd benefit from attending a bootcamp or two to get the basics. 
* Virtual Assistant: Typically this involves appointment setting, calendar management, making travel plans, sending emails, etc., This market is suuuuper saturated but it's a nice gig if you can get it. And you typically don't have to interact with a ton of people face to face.

Keep in mind that while it IS 100% possible to get a good job and live a happy life without a degree... the degree helps. It really does depend what you want to do and where you want to go, but the degree is definitely gonna help you get most places.",9,1696429850.0,k3flol0

findapath,electrician,comment,16zjray,,"Software/web development (coding) doesn't require a degree and pays relatively high compared to other careers. Many people are self-taught or go to a coding bootcamp. It's also good for people with social anxiety as you rarely need to lead meetings and spend most of the time coding at your computer. It's also a job that is very capable of being done remotely, and most developers prefer to WFH since the pandemic. YSK there is currently a big push for ""return to office"" across the nation, though, and it might be difficult to find a remote job until the economy picks up and hiring increases again.

The path to becoming a programmer usually starts with whether it interests you or not. If you have never done any programming/scripting before, you can check out sites like codecademy and pick a language like Python and follow tutorials there. Give it a little time to ""click."" If you find yourself enjoying it or being interested in it, then you are probably perfectly capable of learning it to the degree to start a career in it.

If deciding to start it as a career, look at your local area's programming jobs and identify languages, tech stacks that are most in-demand in your area. For example, my city has a lot of C# .NET developer jobs. If you go the way of coding bootcamps, they usually teach you languages which are most-utilized in your area. 

If you go the way of self-taught, then you can use courses from sites like Udemy or Pluralsight  to learn from home. There's even decent stuff on YouTube. The most importanrt thing is identifying personal projects that you can do at home to demonstrate your knowledge. Contributing to open source projects on Github is also a very good goal and easy way to demonstrate.",1,1696426153.0,k3fchk2

findapath,electrician,comment,16zjray,,"I got in from a lucky referral at a small start-up agency and everything was taught to me on the job. They were happy to hire me with no prior experience.

Nowadays it seems a little harder to get this job without experience, but best bet would be to look for advertising agencies. Agencies are modeled after high turnover because they work you to death, but you learn A LOT in that period of time, enough to eventually apply to bigger companies.

Also as I said, take the online certification courses offered by the Trade Desk (Edge Academy), DV360, and Campaign Manager 360 (or Google Ads) and add them to your LinkedIn profile. Read articles about Programmatic Advertising, do your own research on what DSPs are out there (Trade Desk, DV360, and Amazon are sitting at the top 3 I believe). At the minimum, platform familiarity and concepts can be easily self-taught on your computer. But every company utilizes DSPs slightly differently, so every job will have some level of learning on the job.",1,1700520084.0,ka2uqv0

findapath,plumber,post,17y9u2y,Apprentice plumber with too many interests,"This will be a long-winded post, it's just the nature of what I need to write at this moment.

Something I heard some years ago stuck with me as good advice: As we age, we need to hone and narrow our focus. Makes sense to me. The problem is that I'm interested in a lot of different things and suppose I have a hard time following through.

It also seems like the grass is always greener on the other side. For example, I went to college for sustainable development because it sounded cool and higher education was expected in my family. It's just what everyone did. Since I didn't have any personal drive to be there, I didn't value the experience very much. I'd spend nights in the library reading any fascinating thing I could, which was usually about natural health and wellness and not related to any of my coursework at all.

I also operated under this pretense of what many family friends told me growing up; ""you'll drift away from the friends you make in high school, but the friends you make in college will be your lifelong friends"". I didn't realize how much this program impacted me to socialize even though I'm a bit of an introvert. Basically, I spent a lot of time ""hanging out"" and doing dumb shit with my peers. We'd take hallucinogens (was a liberal arts school), smoke pot, get drunk, go to concerts, etc. I ended up developing a chronic illness and had to take medical leave from school.

After some months of introspection and bad habits living with my mother, I decided to go to a massage school in a town a few hours away. Only when I was looking for housing, I ended up getting involved with a high control group (think Andean shamanic cult with a Christian flavor). They claimed to offer ""Spiritual training"" for $5,000 a year plus the cost of workshops and crystals (LOL). So, I didn't go to massage school and instead pursued this path for 9 years. Yes, nine years. It didn't help that when I was 22 I inherited $72,000 as a lump sum brokerage account from my deceased grandfather. I had money and basically worked for free for this ""foundation"". No exaggeration, I worked (on my own and with some of the other male students) 7 days a week from 8-5 doing hard physical labor (think pouring concrete slabs, setting pipes in concrete as fence posts, welding heavy metal fences from plate steel, using a concrete saw and sledge hammer to remove and redo old concrete work, building new temples, etc.) unless we were in a ""workshop"" doing some fire ceremony, ""clearing ancestral debt"", recapitulation, or whatever was being pushed/""taught"" at the time.

We were expected to be available at the drop of a hat to be in another state or country. That meant having a passport and credit cards. I'd get sent to my birthplace (a remote pacific island nation) for a ""short period of time"" and end up there for a year on multiple occasions. I had to get very creative with how to survive because I was running out of money at this point. I'd find jobs, rent rooms and when I really ran out of money, I would WWOOF or find farms to do some kind of a work trade/work exchange for rent/food and sometimes a little cash.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when I got a phone call (for the first time in a year) that I needed to pack up and head to Mt. Shasta and then to South America. At this time I had found myself working on a horse ranch and avocado orchard and although it was a tough situation, I had actually been able to save a few thousand dollars. But I was still underwater in credit card debt and unpaid capital gains tax. I realized that I had no sovereignty over my life and stopped answering their phone calls. They called and called and I just let the phone ring. I couldn't put up with this anymore. I was going to live my own life.

I signed up for a trade school program for plumbing pretty much just as something to do. I was desperate to have a path forward in life and it almost didn't matter to me what it was. I just wanted something that would allow me some income growth potential and a way to contribute to society. I needed practical skills other than burning sage and offering sacred reciprocity to the ocean and mountain Spirits (some sarcasm here). I was 30.

Now I'm 32 and have nearly 2 years of residential service plumbing experience and although I'm not passionate about it, it's cool to be able to solve pretty much any problem with a residential plumbing system. One caveat is that I live with my mother which is hard for both of us. I spent the last two years gaining financial literacy and have been able to pay off my debt as well as save or invest 45% of my income. I make $21.50 an hour which sucks. I want to move out but I don't want roommates. I want to live alone. I can't afford this without living mostly paycheck to paycheck. I've saved about 3 months worth of living expenses and can afford my next car in cash (current one has a quarter million miles).

Other relevant considerations are that I might have an eating disorder. I plan on moving to a larger city where I can have access to support groups because I literally have no friends, which is sort of by design. I'm an introvert and don't want to try to unload my problems onto someone else, but I also know that in support groups, there is some space for that. I went to a therapist for a little while, but I wasn't a huge fan. The guy was nice but he wore a mask the whole time and it was hard to read him and feel a genuine connection.

I know I'm kind of all over the place here and I apologize for that. To refocus a little bit on ""finding a path"" it's relevant to share that I'm at a B1/B2 intermediate level in Spanish speaking from being self-taught. I don't like doing new construction plumbing that much, but one of the things I love about being on RNC jobsites is conversing with the Hispanic subs. Many of them don't speak a lick of English and racism is somewhat prevalent in my area (American South). For this reason, there can be a little tension between the two racial groups and I enjoy very much being that bridge. Last week a guy shared his tacos with me at lunch and we had a great conversation. I witnessed the face of an elder stone mason completely light up when he was leaving for the day and I told him ""Goodbye & take care"". We shook hands and went our separate ways. I enjoy learning this language and I think of everything I do, being a linguistic and cultural bridge is my favorite. I would love to find a way to leverage this for a better paying role, perhaps one that isn't even plumbing related, who knows?

Also, I'm discovering an interest in personal and corporate finance. I enjoy helping my coworkers find a security allocation that works for them and how to choose between account types for their needs. I'm at the end of the line with this redneck company and they don't offer any kind of benefits. I've enjoyed sharing with some of them how to save and invest for the long haul. Not everyone is interested, which is fine, but some are. I've been spending weekends reading different types of investing books and also trying to figure out how I can get in with a different plumbing company.

In my state, I can be licensed in about 4 more months, but I don't anticipate running my own business or anything at that point. I don't even really like plumbing, but I like being able to work on my own stuff and help family and the friends I hope to have in the future. Supposedly I should be studying plumbing code and I do more than my coworkers, but as I'm demonstrating, I have many interests which makes it hard to go too deep into any one thing.

Before I dilute my feelings and expression too much, I'll end this post here. I just needed to share this with someone and would love any insights about a potential life path that maybe I'm not seeing here. I would be grateful for any constructive advice that you could offer. If you read this much, you are a hero! Have a great weekend!",0,1700324144.0,

I made tons of professional connections there and while I live in a town with 200,000+ people, I run into them everywhere still. I decided I wanted more than answering phones so I started applying everywhere. Especially places that I *blatantly* didn’t have the skills for. Places that required at least some certs or degrees (I have none) in industries that I have no experience with. The worst they can say is no. 

Ended up with one interview at my current job and it happened to be with someone that knew someone I met at an event (I later volunteered with their organization before this interview every happened) and was hired instantly and they’re training me. They told me they rather have someone they know then someone with a degree. Definitely not the usual path.

Three pieces of advice: 

1) lack of planning on your part doesn’t make it an emergency on mine. 

2) work at 85% but do it well. You can’t give them 100% all the time - it’s unsustainable. It’s how you burn out. Gradually drop down to 85% - so you can factor in regular breaks. When the shit hits the fan, you’ll still have a second gear you can transition into. And when all hell breaks loose, you’ll still have a third gear.

I create bills of shipping, cut lists for the shop, create plasma programs for our plasma table to cut and liaise with my counterpart on location to make sure things are going smoothly and to deal with any issues on my projects.

I originally moved up for the position but eventually left to come back to my home city after I started a family.

If you're interested more in the math aspect, I would take an engineering technology course or university for a degree in engineering.

If you're a student get a student version of a design software (inventor, Creo, SolidWorks, etc...) I use Inventor and Vault at my current job and used Creo and Windchill previously.

findapath,plumber,comment,17ukam7,,"These are all good ass fullfilling jobs that people take pride in doing. The rates in this picture aren’t union rates. Also trade pay rates very A LOT depending on where you work. Generally speaking blue states pay so much more, that tradesmen from red states travel to blue states for work. The pay I describe below is about right for the entire west coast

Apply for a trade union apprenticeship. Google “electricians union near me” “operators union in my city” “pipe fitters union in my city or state”  “elevator mechanics union near me” “glaziers union near me” however you want to word it.

All those jobs pay over 100k a year in cities and pretty well in any job market.

A union will take you on as an apprentice with zero skills, connections, ability, knowledge, or experience. Absolutely none at all, and they will get you to work with local unionized contractors. They (the contractors and other workers) will train you on the job from the ground up and their will be infrequent in class elements (through the union) to progress your training.

The barrier to joining a trade union is the same for all of them, so theirs no reason to do a lower paid trade union. Avoid the carpenter, laborers, dry wallers and painters, brick layers. Stuff like that. If your a journeyman in those unions you won’t make enough to provide for a family in today’s economy so it’s not a good enough wage.

They all offer unbeatable health insurance. A pension that is well funded, a pension is when you get paid every month after you retire, until the day you die. It’s the best form of retirement, most companies don’t offer it anymore because it cost them profit. Unions have pensions.

Their will be multiple options for career paths and apprenticeships for every union, the barrier to entry is the same so their is no incentive to pursue a lower paid path.

Electricians union. Their will be multiple programs available that are worded ambiguously. Choose the one that is the longest. It will pay the most money.

Pipe fitters unions. Includes HVAC, sprinkler fitters, plumbers (union plumbers instal on a big scale. They’re not doing house calls cleaning doo doo. But also the doo do job is one of the most important jobs in the country and the pay reflects that) , pipe fitters. Every HVAC guy I know hates his job, something about insulation I don’t know to be honest. Don’t do HVAC. Plumbers is nice because you can do handyman work on the side and make good money, but all the routes available in the pipe fitters union are well paid good options. (Except HVAC guys. They just hate their jobs… I don’t know why…)

Operators union. Can be tricky, not all pay is the same. If you learn to run more complicated or in demand equipment you’ll generally make more money. Cranes, graders, excavators, concrete pumps. Make a lot of money. Haul truck, roller. Not so much (still pretty good though).

Glaziers. Glazing is a good ass job, dudes make bank. For some reason their union seems to be tied into some lower paid trades like painting and stuff. Make sure to only apply for the glaziers route.

Elevator, escalator mechanics. Best job in the world. Only bring on new apprentices when a journeyman dies and the wait list is years long. Everyone who gets in, is a child of an elevator mechanic or has a mob or political connection. Applying is free though so who knows what will happen. No point in not applying.

Now theirs a trick to applying for an apprenticeship. For some reason the office the staff at the union hall, will guranteed. Be complete cunts to you, and also lie directly to your face and try and convince you that you cannot do the job, and also that you don’t even want the job, and that the job possibly even doesn’t even exist, their is no work available, it’s  a bad time too apply (which doesn’t make any sense at all. Waiting too apply doesn’t help you in any way whatsoever. Even if work is slow, you’ll be first on the list when it picks up and have your interview and testing process out of the way. You gain absolutely nothing from waiting to apply), that you cannot apply and your application won’t be accepted, and that it will be a bad career choice if you do. I don’t know why they do it, but for some reason they all do that to every single prospective apprentice. Just ignore them and apply to the best of your abilities, submit all the paperwork and fill out all the forms. The second tip is, they will not call you back for the next step of the process. After you apply, you need to call them and check on the process of your application and find out what the next step is and how to complete that step. Also their is a good chance your application “got lost” and you’ll need to apply again, it’s not personal they’re just cunts to everyone and it’s part of the process. It will normally be an interview or test of some kind. They will not call you and sign you up for that interview without you calling them, and they won’t warn you about that.

It’s fullfilling work, doing meaningful stuff, and generally speaking most skilled construction workers I know love their jobs. Theirs a reason why construction workers point out projects they work on, and share what they do on social media. Because we are proud of what we do and we enjoy it. Every career path I listed here makes enough money to raise a family on. Apprentices typical start out making a percentage of journeymen wage and get raises over time until they become a journeyman. It’s a program that s enforced through the state and federal government using high level lawyers and politicians. You will advance, you will make more money, you will have a good career. As long as you show up on time and don’t complain. Go union and only work union jobs for the rest of your life. Working non union is idiotic and their is no advantage of any kind.

findapath,plumber,comment,17ukam7,,"A PLC Programmer in every job I've seen (or been in) for the last 20 years pays $20 to $30 per hour. For the PLC Programmers that make $40+ per hour; most of them are making $40 to $85 per hour --- for a 3 week project here, for a 1-week project here, for a 3-month project there, and for another project where it is 2-weeks this month, 3 more weeks two months later, and then four months later, they get another 2-weeks out of the job.    
The PLC Programmers at those rates are usually spending half of the year trying to locate freelance jobs for the other half of the year... and they usually have zero benefits.  But they sure do wear out their own vehicles and lots of airline seats.  


If you're a PLC Programmer in a single factory; that means you do all sorts of other work and then do the PLC Programming work as it arises.   Tuesday, you may be replacing a valve in a toilet. Wednesday, you may be unclogging the ice machine in the breakroom -- where you see all the nasty slime and goo that clogs those things -- at least you learn to never use the ice machine again.   And then a PLC Programming job comes up...   Your assignment: add a new step in the middle of this machine cycle to make two more checks for components that have been added by an updated product design.  It takes you 10 minutes to get your laptop; connect to the network, connect to the machine's PLC.  You sift through the program, noticing undocumented (unlabeled) changes that someone else made to the program without saving the latest version to the network -- and they all deny being the culprit.  Anyway, you first figure out what they added and you update the logic with labels and notes.  Then, a manager comes by and asks, ""Are you done yet?""  What?  I haven't been given the details of what I'm adding, I was just making sure I had the current program so that I could review it and be ready to start the update.   The non-programmer manager and/or supervisor:  ""All you have to do is add this, this, and this and then slap another line in the program, right?""    That means you now have to walk away so production can keep running and then you are called to an ""emergency"" breakdown in another department --- it might be a PLC thing, it might be an electrical problem, it might be a hydraulic problem, it might be the case where nothing no longer works because the parts being loaded into a machine have some change that no one communicated and then another machine has to be adjusted and modified right there, right then, on the fly --- mechanically, electrically, and logically (plc code).    So, you spend the rest of the workday confirming that they want this machine update or find out that the part was or wasn't supposed to be changed... then you update this 2nd machine.    The first machine needs to be done by tomorrow because they just told you about the new deadline since all you got to do is ""type: tap tap tap, tap-tap, tap-tap-tap tap and click"" and abra-cadabra, it's DONE!    The reality is that you can't ""think"" to develop a program modification because the plant is incredibly noisy, the bosses are non-stop ""noisy"", and you're going on 16 hours today.

In most cases, you're developing new PLC code for this update at home, on your time, for free.  You get your best ideas in the shower and then you wake up with great ideas too.   (Ok, all types of writers get ideas like that).  But you're doing hours and hours of work at home, working for free.

Yeah, not ALL PLC jobs are like this, but most of them are definitely like this. Your bosses, managers, and owners don't understand what PLC Programming is and if you have to design a new machine, or a major overhaul of an existing one, they don't understand the time involved -- and they don't understand that you can't always come up with something in a flash while in the middle of a factory with a thousand different things clanging in your ears.  Even when you do it at work, you're pulled away every five minutes to do something else. 

18 years as a PLC and Robot Programmer in an automotive supplier facility...   I'll never again do any work for free.  At first, I accepted it as ""free training"" as there is always something to learn... but it got out of hand.   And it wasn't just the programming; I was working 70 to 80 hours per week anyway, for more than 10 of those 18 years.   New owners/new management cut out the PLC jobs on 2nd and 3rd (I was on 2nd, the 3rd shift guy was new and just went back to his previous job in another department... he thought he was going to be ""sitting around playing on a laptop all day"").  There were two on 1st.  They were put on salary; one bailed right then. The other stayed since he was near retirement.     


I was hourly, earning a six-figure income due to the massive amount of overtime.   First I was going to be put on salary or the awesome annual total of $33,000.  I laughed.  Then they were going to demote me and put me in another department...  starting at the lowest wage in the plant $16.50.  I never gave an answer of which I chose... because they decided that they'd just kick me to the curb.   12 people already had job leads and bailed.  8 of us were kicked to the curb all on the same day.  :)",1,1699972831.0,k97t577

findapath,plumber,comment,17ukam7,,"When I got my crappy Associate degree in electronics in 1992...  I went to a union hall to see how that worked.  They asked ""who is your sponsor?""  What?  Everyone just said to come down here.  ""You can't join without a sponsor"" is what I was told more than a dozen times.   Over 10 years or more, this is what they told me every time I walked in the door.   Now, they (and everyone else) say that is NEVER how they operated.  Uh, yes, it was how they operated.

I went to school to get a trade but I screwed up by going to school for electronics...   I had no money; could not get a student loan because my parents (father) would provide tax info or a signature for that sort of thing.   Yeah, this is pre-Internet, etc.   But he would assist me in going to an electronics school... they are out of business now; you might guess who they are.   After two months in, you're committed to 100% of the tuition. I tried to talk to my dad about problems with the school... he just screamed at me, ""you don't appreciate anything""... the 2-month mark came, so I was stuck paying 100% whether I finished or not.   I finished.  


Learned about:  
DC Voltage, Electron/Hole Flow, Dry cell batteries, Digital logic (most of the course's focus): 7400 series ICs - logic gates, transistor (as a switch), resistor, capacitor (never used one in a circuit), switches, diodes, LEDs.  
We built little circuits on a ""protoboard"" -- not a wire-wrap thing they kept talking about... just a protoboard or project board where we plugged in components and built circuits with jumper wires.  


We soldered ONE DAY -- we soldered ends on a piece of coaxial cable to use it as an oscilloscope probe, instead of using a proper one.  We used the scope during ONE DAY... all we had to measure was a DC voltage from our fixed power supply which had 12 & 5VDC.  The only ones who were able to display an AC wave were those who stuck the lead into the 110V receptable on the workbench.  That was the only time we ever saw a scope in 2 years.  
We never once saw a circuit board.    
MY rant could go on for days... that was the tech school where I got my degree.   I didn't know about the place until I was in... I tried to get out and go to the smaller school, but my dad prevented that. Going here was his decision.",1,1699973656.0,k97v6m6

That is when the wish for a retraining poster child, turned into a nightmare of market forces.  There were already enough HVAC technicians (since it was a high paying job) to service the area around the steel mill.  The newly trained technicians wouldn't get hired in serious numbers and weren't needed in the marketplace.  The program lacked job placement and relocation assistance so those folks probably ended up being Baristas or on disability.

Is that you won’t make even the lowest amount listed above after taking the time to learn the skill in the first place. You have to apprentice first and there are levels of apprenticeship involved, in most cases. All apprentices make a fraction of the money they should or would otherwise. Not even enough to live on more or less keep your equipment up to date. 

To even attend the trade school? You have to first be able to afford the cost of the trade school and afford the up to 5000 dollar set of tools and protective gear that are only just the most basic of gear, because you’ll need it just to participate in classes the first place. 

And even though trade school takes between 4 months and two years? YOU STILL HAVE TO APPRENTICE FOR UP TO 6 years. The entire time paying your own way on less than minimum wage because you’re still apprenticing. 

Trade school is an excellent alternative, but all around it takes just as long and is almost just as expensive as attending a 4 year university for your bachelors. 

I’m all for trade school. If you make it through you have a guaranteed income unlike a four year degree from whatever college, but it’s not ultimately cheaper. And in some cases it’s more difficult than just going to college.

>•	⁠You're competing with electrical engineers for robot programmer jobs, and PLC programmer jobs. You're not going to get one with a 2 year degree. Mechatronics is also a 4 year degree.
•	⁠Mandated overtime hours. After I've worked a 40hr week, I've done enough. That's a full time job. You don't deserve anymore of my time.
•	⁠Workplace toxicity in blue collar jobs is much worse than in white collar jobs. Yes, there's office drama.

If you did any of those in a white collar environment, you'd get fired immediately.
•	⁠Vocational schools still cost a lot of money.

If you do you get into a trade union, you don’t have to work more than eight hours. Union jobs typically also come with pensions. Office jobs typically have 401(k)s. Pensions are a lot more substantial, then 401(k)s. Most trades are applicable to the real world. Learn a trade, work whenever you want. Join a union and enjoy all the benefits that entails.

But sure keep going because I’ve worked both types of jobs and I can tell you blue collar jobs are far more cutthroat.

White collar jobs come with a contract or a salary..

So you get paid the same for 35hrs as for 40.

Also why are you being evil for a leg up when everyone here works on contract so if you want a leg up you need to “build out” your resume.

You don’t get more by undercutting you get more by expanding what you can provide to the company.

(Aka more education or general certs get you pay bumps)

So yeah.. I think you should quit Blue collar and try White collar.

You’d be pleasantly surprised not just by people acting fake nice… but by probably meeting some really nice people.

And to be clear there are great people in trades but trades has a way of taking advantage of a person and (sometimes) they can kill a persons body/spirit along the way.

Trades people are often jaded and think “good work ethic” = good pay but that’s often not the case.

To get good pay you either had to (go back to school or get a general cert… recognize something here from earlier?)

Or you had to be born into it like a nepo baby..

There is no such thing as a good paying (low skill low education) blue collar job.

Every single high paying blue collar job might as well say it takes college…

You can’t be master electrician without the certs, master welder (golden arms?) Same thing.. 

You can’t even be a top plumber without school and most of those guys who are able to read the blueprints go to contractor schools.

So sure you can work your way up from the bottom BUT at some point school or certs will be in your way so just like white collar workers..

In the mill, insults and threats flew thick.  I've had to bust up fights and restrain coworkers before.  If you bent over for anything, you could expect to have your oil checked.  At retirement or the day before your wedding, you could expect to have your pants cut off and be painted with something like Prussian blue.  Someone would attempt to drown you with a water hose or a bucket of water regularly.  

But if you had something personal going on, no one would hesitate to step in and cover you while you took care of it.  I could have called any of those assholes at 3 in the morning, and they would have showed up to pull me out of whatever mess I was in with a smile and an insult.

People don’t realize just how much working can take a toll on the body. If it isn’t back breaking/joint damaging labor, it’s a sedentary lifestyle and carpal tunnel and eye strain doing office work, or constant exposure and contracted illnesses in the medical professions.

The only jobs I can really think of that might be safe from this sort of stuff would be maybe dietitians and certain artistic fields? Therapists perhaps? Though therapists tend to have a lot of emotional repercussions from their job, so that’s out.

findapath,plumber,comment,17ukam7,,"Embedded stuff is pretty useful just for knowing some basic wiring and programming real objects. My path was, and it's not necessarily typical, was I did get a 4 year degree in comp sci but was a little bit naive in what the job market would be like and didn't specialize myself fresh out of college in May 2020. Bad timing and didn't prepare myself to be great candidate in SWE. I wound up just getting a job as an operator in the meantime so I could readjust. I used Udemy to take some PLC courses, which was pretty different programming than what I was used to but the fundamentals were there. Probably the same for you if you can do some arduino. I worked hard and showed aptitude in my operator job, let people know what I was doing, and was lucky enough that my plant needed more programming help in less than a year of hire. I held an Electrical engineering title despite not really knowing much about wiring and hardware before learning a lot on the job. One thing about it is you need to be able to adapt quickly because nobody can know everything and you earn your keep when nobody has a clue what's going on. I recently moved and now have a more accurate Controls Engineer title for a system integrator, which can give a lot of experience really fast. 

In short my advice is get yourself in an industry, show initiative on your own time, go the extra mile and earn respect. Don't listen to the idiots that tell you to the bare minimum that's the worst career advice in the world. You'll make that money back with the doors you open for yourself. Manufacturing in general will provide a lot of great career paths and you can get out what you put into it. They will train people. I did have luck and a four year degree, so I wouldn't expect it to work as quickly as it did for me. But sometimes luck is actually just being prepared to snap at opportunities once they arise.

It's a lot of fun running mills, Gradalls, excavators, and dozers(in one right now waiting on trucks!).  I started doing it as income while getting my Software Engineering degree and still get mocked for ""wasting my money on student loans"", but it's not too terrible.

It's a nice, active job where you get to be outside a lot if that's your thing, and the union obviously has a lot of great benefits.

I've had success over the years just trying to be respectful and positive with coworkers and not be known as one of the ""ball-busters"" and people just kind of drop the act and are pleasant.  Of course there are still ""alpha"" types who will always talk smack, but they are fewer and far between.

It's a good option for those who maybe don't have the money or situation for a degree pursuit or maybe just like working with their hands, and I won't knock anyone who likes this lifestyle or white-collar as I've done both and worked with great people.

So if they can afford to pay OT and still make profit… That shows you all you (should) need to see.

Math people know this so do the math and stop gifting away your life for money..

(Work smarter from today and you’ll make more money than those idiots working OT while at the same time enjoying what we call: Quality of Life)

QOL comes from free time you can spend on family, community, or self improvement.

QOL does not come from OT or money… sorry it just doesn’t",2,1699951475.0,k96tu2d

Welder: $21.97

Electrician w/o certs: $28.29

Tool and die maker: $27.83

HVAC tech/mechanic: $28.44

CNC Machinist: $24.85

Plumber: $25.22

findapath,plumber,comment,17ukam7,,">all govt jobs are unionized

I can tell you from experience that this is untrue.

>that’s the only way they can get away with paying so little

First off, yes, government jobs almost always pay less than equivalent work in the private sector. However, I still make a solid wage at $76,440 a year ($36.75 if calculated hourly). And, that comes with excellent benefits that most private companies couldn't, or wouldn't, provide, unionized or not, and a great work-life balance. 

If I were to calculate the value of my benefits only, excluding the intangible value of work-life balance, alongside my pay, I likely make close to as much as, or more than, someone in an equivalent position in the private industry. Hell, the value of my employer's portion of my health insurance is $12,000 a year (80% of the premium, I pay the other 20%). The rest of my benefits easily put me close to or over the $100,000 mark.

Also, it's precisely because of my union that I have such a great compensation package. You'd have to pay me A LOT, like we're talking double my current salary at minimum, to get me to even consider moving to the private sector because there's no way the benefits would be as good as I currently have.

It's not always the case. Maybe you're fine with the idea of only living to your 80s. The fear of dementia or alzheimers. But, if you aren't part of a genetically predisposed group that get those diseases. Which are 2/3rds of Americans. Then you could in theory, live a perfectly normal life and live much later. It might not seem like a big deal. But the things most people associate with retirement such as traveling and exploring are just not going to be affordable for you. Instead, your life is sitting alone for hours on end. Maybe you go out occasionally but if you're living off of just social security you can't afford it.

findapath,plumber,post,18ugabr,Does anybody disagree that the trades is one of the greatest wealth hacks people sleep on?,"The trades are among the greatest wealth cheat codes people sleep on!

I wanted to add a reply to someone who just said job hopping is the greatest wealth cheat. I'm going to say trades are among the greatest wealth cheat codes people sleep on.

Aviation mechanics, plumbers, electrician, HVAC attendants, elevator mechanics, truckers, etc. are the greatest jobs people sleep on. Many people look at a trucker or a plumber and think they didn't go to a university so they're not on the level of many professionals. These mechanics could open up businesses, get paid tons of money as journeymen, they're recession proof, and if they're smart with their money they could become millionaires.

People who think truckers can't become millionaires they may not be higher income but in NJ, NY, CA, if you work for Walmart, you can make >100k. You can live in your truck. Your job is recession proof. Same with mechanics, aviation mechanics, journeymen (who make usually 40-50/hr), linesmen, elevator repairmen.

I remember reading engineers normally start at 70k maybe 90k depending on the state. They get paid salary. The electrician journeymen make 40-50/hr and there's always overtime especially if you work for the state. You can make well over 150k I've read some journeymen make over 200k with all the overtime.

No schooling needed but trade school helps. They accept convicted felons. They are recession proof.

I know it's hard work but for the guys who smart with their money and invest into real estate or stocks they can pretty soon open their own business and help out new apprentices and work much less while collecting rent or dividends or selling appreciated stocks.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"I disagree but mostly because of where I live and my experience with the trades. 

I live in a mid size city in the Canadian prairies and the culture here is very rural, working class and trades oriented despite being a city of close to 1m people. I have to laugh every time I see posts like “end the stigma against trades! Teach your kids it’s ok to be a plumber! etc etc” because here it is the exact opposite. People with “honest” jobs are celebrated and Lawyers, Doctors, Accountants get a lot of distrust and are seen as elites trying to swindle the Everyman out of his hard earned money. 

Then there’s the “trades are in demand and you’ll make great money!” Side of it. Again that seems very different here based on my (admittedly anecdotal) experience. The common ticketed trades (electrician, hvac, etc) are almost impossible to get into because everyone and their dog wants to be an electrician and the entry level job market is saturated with apprentice hopefuls. You need an in. Also the level 1 and level 2 rates are embarrassingly low - barely more than minimum wage. You can make more money bartending or waiting tables and I think many young people avoid the trades because they can’t afford to make so little money while pursuing their journeyman. The real money is in being a business owner / self employed but it’s such a stressful and hard life, people work themselves into an early grave trying to compete as self employed tradespeople. 

Thirdly the culture is a problem imo. The older experienced guys whose job it is to train the next generation are often miserable jaded pricks. Toxic work culture is the name of the game. Also right wing politics are dominant and if you have left of centre views on just about anything you won’t succeed on certain crews. This isn’t a hard rule obviously but there’s a lot of it where I’m from. 

So that’s my take. I went to college for welding as a young adult and despite enjoying the work and being pretty good at it I couldn’t find a job that was a good fit for me. Interviewed and got offers for a couple jobs but didn’t have a good feeling about either and they both paid significantly less than I was making as a middle manager at my service industry job.",2,1703955757.0,kfkpith

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"I wouldn’t call it a wealth hack unless you own a construction business. 

But I’ll certainly say that many tradesman do better on average than people with useless degrees who never achieve gainful employment. 

Further, they do essential work for our society to function. They also do the jobs most other people do not want to do or cannot do because they’re so physically demanding. 

I tried the trades and couldn’t hack it. Worked for my dad at his tax office in the offseason and went back to school for accounting.

Many tradesman earn 60-80k so they aren’t poor. But they risk their lives for that money. 

I’ve done many tradesman’s taxes so I’ve seen what they make. IMO they are massively underpaid.

Further, I got offered a position as an accountant out of school and I will start at what a journeyman bricklayer/mason tops out at. 

Here’s my honest opinion on the trades, they are a better path financially for many people. Especially for people who prefer to work with their hands compared to working on a computer. You don’t need to worry about getting arrested because it won’t ruin your career, and if you come to America and have few options, the trades will afford you a middle class lifestyle.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"I personally haven't seen it as a ""wealth hack"".  I've seen it as a source of consistent income that isn't going to have a lot of layoffs during bad times.

I also think this is wrong though.  I know plenty of people who lost their businesses and their jobs during down turns.  It happens same as everything else.

It's also not great as far as the cost goes.  You save on tuition but you also need to do a pretty hard apprenticeship and pay some tuition to get certifications or go to trade school which can cost a lot depending on where you are.  

It's also just way more dangerous than an office job and harder on your body.  So you'd need to include that as part of the calculation.  Also the ""good ol boy"" culture that basically just amounts to abuse of new people and poor safety culture.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"I was taught this as a teenager and tried to follow this advice. From my experience: 

It won't make you rich, but if everything breaks your way, it can make you comfortable. In many people's cases, especially the most poor of us, it rarely works out. 

My experience: so in high school I went to a program dedicated to getting kids into the trades. It was literally called ""Construction Trades"" and it taught you all about the apprenticeship standards in my state and gave you introductions to a variety of basic trades, like carpentry and welding. I did well in the program, enjoyed it greatly, star student, ect ect. 

Then came time to actually get into a trade. The top three I was interested in automatically rejected me because I would either have to move to where the jobs/apprenticeships were (I had no way to do that) or I had to have reliable transportation to get to job sites when they wanted me to (I didn't get a car until I was 19, and I was the first in my immediate family to have one in over a decade). Pretty much every other option either had physical demands I couldn't meet, I hated the work, or you had to know someone to get in. Nepotism is strong in the trades and many don't realize it. 

So after inadvertently taking a gap year trying to find something, I decided to attend a college program that was essentially an apprenticeship to get you into being a CNC machinist. You know those 3d printers? Those, but cutting materials instead of printing them, and often much bigger. 

This actually panned out somewhat; between finally getting a car with fast food job money, my previous carpentry training in high school and my new CNC training, I ended up working in a custom cabinetry business, cutting out the pieces to be built into the cabinets from huge sheets of material. Mostly various flavors of MDF, particle board and plywood, but occasionally actual wood. The hours were brutal, the work was physically difficult and mind numbing, the pay was not good, no benefits. I was eventually fired because my ""work quality was decreasing"". My entire family had been evicted and I was sleeping on a hardwood floor in an uninsulated room in winter. 

What I learned: trades are largely still run by boomers and rife with nepotism. If you can ""tough it out"" and ""earn it"" or are born into a trade family, then yeah it can pan out. Being a master in any skill, trade or non, is always lucrative. For the rest of us, you basically just spend several years doing rediculous amounts of physical damage to your body for a pittance and hoping someday your ship will come in. 

Today I've washed up working for my state government doing workers compensation claims. It sucks but it's an ok paycheck and a pension with enough years left to build it up ok, so whatever.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"The place to start with this is to read 'The Millionaire Next Door'. The point of this is that a lot of people have high incomes that do 'scut work': plumbing, diesel mechanic, junk yard, and so forth. These roles change over time, so what was true in the 1970's when the book was written may not be true now. However, the rest of the point is as follows:

'High Prestige' roles such as Lawyer or Doctor sometimes force these practitioners not only into higher spending (houses, luxury cars, etc.) but also into debt. The corporate lawyer makes $500K but lives in a $5 million house, which may have a $3 million mortgage. This house (and the associated neighborhood driven spending) is not optional: his/her clients will not continue to do business if they aren't wined and dined, can't sleep over in a 'nice neighborhood' on short notice out-of-town business trips, and so forth. The income is associated with certain mandatory expectations.

Plumbers, on the other hand, work for anyone that has pipes, which is basically everyone. They drive a van with a RotoRooter hanging out the back. They aren't invited to live in the 'high network individual' neighborhoods. Their kids aren't expected to go to private schools. Therefore, they fly under the radar.

The IRS says that there are about 23 million millionaires in the US, and the Census Bureau says there are about 130 million households in the US. 130/23 = 5.6, so somewhere between 1 in 5 and 1 in 6 households have 'millionaire' level wealth. This number can vary from week to week depending on the stock market.

The 'average' net worth of a US household is now over $1 million, per the US Federal Reserve. Of course, you can drown in a river that is, on average, only six inches deep. What this suggests is that in opposition to the 107 million households worth less than 1 million, 2.3 million households are worth $10 million+, $100 million+, or in the $billions.",1,1703959663.0,kfl03nx

Every trade is hard. You're going to be out in the cold and the heat. You're going to work long hours. You're going to slowly trade your physical health for wages that are enough to get by but never enough to get ahead. Sure some people get experience then start a business and make a shit load of money, but most people are not good at running a business. Don't get me wrong I'm an electrician and I like my job, but if you've never worked physical labor 40 plus hours a week you might be in for a rude awakening. Another thing to keep in mind is that there is no HR on most construction sites. There's been almost no effort in construction to create friendly professional work spaces . You will deal with ass holes, drug addicts, thieves, verbal harassment and the like. Also keep in mind that you will rarely have sanitary bathrooms and in general a construction site is going to have dangerous air quality, noise levels and other hazards. Don't let people blow smoke up your ass. The trades can be an ok career but it's not easy.",1,1703964874.0,kfleelb
findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"Dude you are cherry picking data. The bureau of labor states the average salary for a plumber is 60k or a bit under. That is not wealth and unless you are single for most of your life and live plainly you are not going to be investing in real estate and the stock market except for maybe some small positions using etrade.  

You say most engineers start at 70-90k depending on the state but use California salary for truckers making 100k. In SF bay area a single mom of two needs to make Around 60k to be above the poverty line. 100k there is a dismal salary. We start engineers (good ones) at more than 150k. That will include equity, if in office it’ll be typically two free catered meals a day. Equity can bring life changing wealth. I made 10 million off my first IPO and that was being an early employee and working a lot and no vacation. 

That was for 4 years I bet few plumbers, truck drivers, electricians make 10 mil over their lifetime. And the ones they do are top of their field. I don’t sleep in my truck as you stated when I travel for work I stay in 5 star hotels now.

Avg electrician salaries according to a trade site Workwave
Journeyman electrian ($43,113 – $71,200)
Master ($48,411 – $90,882)

You’ve made the mistake a lot of people make. They excitedly cherry pick stats and think wow 100k? Fuck that is big money. In California where you mentioned that is not great unless you are single and frugal. You won’t be buying a house there let alone investing in real estate. 

200k for a journeyman is for a VERY rare breed with a degree. Not a convict who changed his ways or the average person. Highly driven superior people with a reputation and luck. 

You took very rare outliers and used those salary ranges and or chose states where a big sounding salary will in reality having you broke. 

Please go to a more sober and realistic analysis. I may be off a bit but I looked at several sites, know lots of people in the trades. Have had homes built in a few states. The people living next to me are building an 8 million house- most of the guys working

Making that much within the trades is possible, but the way to get there is to rely on your body to perform hard physical labor, day in and day out, 70 hours six days a week, for 25 years in a row.

I’ve never heard anyone in the middle class complain about trades. Or disparage their careers. Maybe you would hear it from the upper class, but even those people would disparage someone working as a project manager or an engineer because even those jobs are beneath them. 

This idea that it’s a hack to wealth… it takes just as much time as a college degree to get to the point where you are making as much money as someone with a corporate job. Then you have to be smart with your money, and you have to be one of the tradesmen moving up in their careers. It takes a lot of hard work to become wealthy as a tradesman. And even still you’ll only reach the upper middle class. Which is a good way to achieve a comfortable life and retirement so I’m not disparaging it.

But not everyone has the capacity to do these jobs and fewer still have the capability of doing it well. You are looking at a 4-5 year apprenticeship where you are employed by local companies while also attending classes paid for by your employer. These jobs are extremely physically demanding. You are digging trenches, pulling wire, carrying ungodly amounts of weight, and/or spending hour after hour day after day working with your hands above your head. There is no downtime or chatting during your work day. It is down and dirty hustling physical labor from the moment your shift starts to the second it ends.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ugabr,,"The major benefit of a trade is the time value of your money through investing. 

If we look at it from a pragmatic perspective of - 

Trade worker: starts at 19, Goes in making 60k, ends up at 80k for the rest of their career (these are pretty conservative estimates, but depends on the field) 

College degree: Start working at 22 with 40k in debt, goes into career making 50k, but ends up at 150k. 

The time value of the trade worker will be higher than the college degree worker and if both sides are live frugally and invest heavily. Odds are, the trade worker can probably retire much sooner. If you plan to retire at 65, your dollar value is 97x at 19 but it’s only 66x at 22. Then add on the fact that you will have to pay loans, likely have a lower salary at 22 than the trade worker at 22, etc. 

Obviously there’s a ton of nuance in that the type of degree you get, where you get your degree, what trade it is, where you live, etc. all factor in but my point is that people really don’t get that time is the most important factor in creating wealth.

My whole day would consist of writing a few reports, chatting to some work colleagues, and a meeting or two. As long as you aren’t mentally getting brainrot from this type of work, it’s literally the equivalent of those babies play houses but for adults. 

On the other hand, a tradesman earning the same will be working a tough job in a horribly shitty environment and risking his own health, maybe even life in some cases, and/or will be taking the horrible risk of starting your own business, and then he’d be having to start running the entire business on his own back, which gets very very hard beyond simple casual day contracts. 

Yes, it’d be better if less people went to uni, and the trades can be high paying alternatives, but you are reaching to say that they are equivalent, let alone the trades being a money hack.",12,1703954189.0,kfkle50

Once I hit second year my wife was added to my insurance and also began accruing pension contributions. Each year I had pay increases, and being cheap labor I stayed employed for the vast majority of the time I was an apprentice. Spent a total of 3 weeks laid off as an apprentice and 2 weeks as a journeyman. I eventually transitioned to the power sector. Still use my trade knowledge, but am no longer busting ass in the heat and humidity pulling cable, building conduit runs, installing cable tray, digging, etc. However, without that experience I wouldn't have the job I have now. So in my case it worked out tremendously, I also began my electrical career at 30. 

Just made sure I was always on time to work, had my tools, learned as much as possible and experience as much as possible and it paid off. I got a diverse experience from digging trenches for underground feeders, backup generators for assisted living facilities, controls and instrumentation in dairy plants, phosphate mines, chemical plants, motor controls for sauce a dale sauce plant, worked at universities, power plants, and in all sorts of heat, humidity, and weather conditions. 

Most of my classmates didn't finish, but the ones who did are all doing well.

I've gotten to work on huge ass drag lines at the phosphate mines that run on 7200v, big 4160v pumps motors, would perform pit moves for phosphate mining. This involved racking out giant ass breakers and disconnects, re-routing cable, re terminating and verifying rotation, commissioning VFD sleds, I got to build out a control cabinet for a prototype sled used for phosphate mining, got to build the conduit runs and terminate all of the soft start and plc controls for production lines. Got to do a lot of neat stuff. Yes it's hard ass work, and yes it sucks sometimes working and attending class, working overtime, and juggling life.

I was making about 32/hr on the check in the Tampa area when I worked out of the hall. If I wanted to travel like some of my classmates, sure there's money in the 50+/hr range out there. Some locals have amazing benefits packages. Unfortunately in the south the wages and benefits aren't nearly as good, but it's a livable wage. A union inside wireman is going to making at median or above household income for Florida by themselves, so if your spouse works, it's not so bad. Honestly for the longest my wife was working at either a small office or the SPCA and we made it work, things got easier once I became a journeyman. 

I personally didn't want to travel, so I left the construction side and went to a power plant. There's upsides and downsides to both. Upside is more stability and higher pay, downsides are rotating shift schedule and less flexibility in the sense you work directly for the utility. As a union wireman you can drag up jobs at any point to go to another job, just as a contractor is free to lay you off at any given time.

That's really not true everywhere for the IBEW. And again, that really depends on how the local union, how they set their rules, and their location.

I've seen most of the union electricians mentioned at r/electricians and r/skilledtrades  that they got hired on directly as journeymen with their local IBEW halls.

You have superheated steam, high pressure steam, high pressure hydraulic systems, fast rotating generators and motors and pumps, you don't just turn stuff off. You call me lazy but have you ever stuck your hand into generator brush rigging to pull out and replace a brush on a live unit spinning at 3600 rpm? I have, it's not fun.

I've had brushes fail to lock and start sparking and probably nearly tripping the unit. Or pulling on the brushes to check tension, that isn't fun either. 

Now we only do it on the units that are cycled off for safety reasons and to not risk tripping a unit. We still change the steam turbine brushes online, but I don't do the bottom brushes because you're laying in a metal housing unlocking a multi brush holder under a lot of spring tension, that shits too sketchy.

Being a server has been, by far, the easiest job I've ever had. By magnitudes the least stressful. Can it be hectic? yes. Can it be frustrating? yes. Can people eating there drive you crazy with their attitude? yes. But by no means is it difficult once you learn your menu and culture for the restaurant. The only hard part is the hours, in my opinion. 

Management can be toxic or good anywhere. Clients/customers can be awful anywhere. Substance abuse is a choice one makes at any job and ive known of more coworkers doing coke in the office than any restaurant. Turnover is high because the job is easy. People know they can get a new job in the industry by end of day. It also attracts folks who have a hard time due to their past, maybe learning disabilities, health issues etc. and these factors lead to the high turnover.

A 6 figure salary may be seasonal, but at the end of the year your W-2 is still 6 figures. It doesn't matter what time of the year you earn the bulk of it so long as you earn it. 

Once you've had a real job that's stressful, where you worry about your job-security based on performance, where you have to deal with variables way outside of your control that lead to angry coworkers/boss/client, where you stay up all night learning something for weeks and still don't understand it, where you can't do your job because of coworkers issues or lack of caring, then you'll learn how easy being a server really is.",1,1700322194.0,k9rwkgl

We often deal with awful things. AI doesn’t do a 1:1 with Bob or Tina and see they are struggling with their work on say a human trafficking group. That great employee at least on my team will see it and help Tina or Bob. Or they’ll let me know and I’ll reach out. I love my people and there is just something necessary about having team mates that genuinely care for each other. AI won’t do that-

However, and my main driving reason, is I really feel like I can make an impact on the real world with an Electrical Engineering degree. I can build my own lab and experiment, maybe go into energy or superconductor research. Seeing people down bad or animals hurt really makes me want to do better for the world (as we fight for resources). I honestly would've tried to be a doctor if blood didn't put me off. That's my main reason. Software makes an enormous impact on the real world as well, but it's one abstraction removed.

I remember tutoring when I was first going through grad school and I got paid something like $30 an hour through a private company with five or six different students I was tutoring in math. It was a simple application, I got a call back really fast, and I met with all my clients at the local library. Any contact I had with my bosses was over the phone or by email and it was super smooth. I was technically self-employed but they took care of everything. I still got paid even if a kid didn't show up, at least for an hour for the missed session, but there was no cap on how often I could meet with a kid so I made good money doing like two or three hour sessions per kid and sometimes hitting 20 hours a week. That was around 2009.

At the tail end of COVID I picked up another tutoring job online. Everything was done through a portal. I was hired by email and there was no application because they considered me a self-employed freelancer while the company was the middleman. They could only find me one student in a faraway state who needed tutoring in a very specific course that he was actually doing fine in.  I got paid 15 bucks an hour and they had a cut off, something like my sessions couldn't be longer than one hour and I couldn't tutor him for more than 10 hours a week. I also only got paid for the time that we met instead of 1 hour minimum like the other place, so if the kid signed off after 30 minutes I only got paid $7.50. The kid didn't even always sign on and I wouldn't always get paid if that happened because the middleman on his end was pretty unreliable -- he had some advisor who had to confirm everything with the company and me or I didn't get paid. I think I made less than 80 bucks tutoring for that company over the course of the semester, which is just a joke. That was in 2021.

Id like you to change your narrative to what is rrally happening and stop punching yourself, hurting yourself first! 
1. You have ADHD. You are in effect (in this post) calling all ADHD people dumb. Stop. 
2. Your ADHD is medicated but not yet correctly. Not all ADHD meds work for all ADHD people. Its genetics, not choices, that make meds work or not. 
3. You are either making dumb choices or your ADHD is, that doesnt mean you are dumb. You recognizing your choices as dumb means you actually have decent intelligence. 
4. Lower intelligence people do not have the capacity to recognize choices as dumb. 
5. You already know what you are doing wrong and that ADHD may be the culprit. Get on different meds or a better diagnosis, then as you can, start ""grit and drive"" to get into way better habits and making better choices. 

Worry about jobs later. You simply need meds that work for you and find a few friends with grit and drive to inspire you (and keep you accountable in their own way).",9,1715953884.0,l4gepc5

There are many jobs that don't require intense academic focus or complex tasks. Let's explore some options together:

1. *Truck Driver*: You mentioned this, and it's a great option! With a license, you can consider driving jobs like delivery, transportation, or even long-haul trucking.

2. *Customer Service*: Many companies need representatives to handle customer inquiries, and this role can be a good fit if you enjoy interacting with people.

3. *Warehouse Work*: Warehouses often need staff for tasks like packing, labeling, and organizing. This role can be a good fit if you're detail-oriented and enjoy hands-on work.

4. *Food Service*: Restaurants, cafes, and food trucks often need staff for roles like serving, hosting, or kitchen assistance.

5. *Janitorial/Cleaning*: If you take pride in keeping things clean and tidy, consider roles like janitorial work, housekeeping, or commercial cleaning.

6. *Landscaping/Groundskeeping*: If you enjoy working outdoors, consider roles like lawn care, gardening, or grounds maintenance.

7. *Animal Care*: Animal shelters, pet stores, or veterinary clinics often need staff for roles like animal handling, walking dogs, or cleaning cages.

8. *Delivery/Pickup*: With the rise of delivery services, consider roles like package delivery, pizza delivery, or pickup services.

9. *Retail Sales*: Stores need sales associates to assist customers, restock shelves, and handle transactions.

10. *Recreation Centers*: Consider roles like lifeguarding, recreation center staff, or youth program assistants if you enjoy working with people and being active.

Remember, these jobs may require some training or certifications, but they can be a great starting point. Don't be afraid to reach out to local businesses, job centers, or staffing agencies for guidance and support.

findapath,plumber,comment,1ctysqq,,"Stop calling yourself dumb. We all have different intelligences, strengths, and adaptability in certain areas. You just have to find yours. I also have ADHD and got a pretty rude -awakening when I got into office work. It’s fucking hell and I hate it, doesn’t mean I’m dumb, just that there’s somewhere else in the world I belong. 

You might want to look for apprenticeships or alternative schools. Schools with interdisciplinary models or that don’t do letter grades were what got me my degree. I also figured out I like hands-on work a lot more than sitting in front of a computer. If you’re partial to the outdoors, something like landscaping or construction might be good, but those are pretty hard on the body so be sure to try and pick up other skills if you go that route. Looking into trades like electrician, plumber, woodworker are also excellent for busy bodies who like an ebb and flow of work. 

I think above all, what works best for procrastinators, those with ADHD, those who have trouble focusing on one thing or on one thing for too long, who have to feel ‘moved by the spirit’ to actually get work done, self-employment is the ultimate goal. Find something that motivates and interests you, something you believe you can get good at, and build a business around it. Work to get to a place where you can set your own hours, work at your own pace, and have no one on your ass about it.

ETA: Also, if you’re in the US, ADHD is a disability and those who have it are a protected class under ADA laws. If you are upfront about your disability when you get hired they must provide reasonable accommodation and cannot fire you for it.",1,1715979939.0,l4ig0k4

findapath,plumber,comment,1ctysqq,,"I had two roommates in my undergrad that have ADHD pretty strongly. One just graduated with her bachelor of science in social work and the other is graduating next December. My friend who just graduated took some pretty heavy medication for her ADHD, which helped her get good enough grades to graduate. My other friend needs to take one more semester but this is not just because of her ADHD. She sometimes says things like “I wish things came as easily to me as though do to you (me who is writing this comment who also graduated this semester and who does not have ADHD)” or “I wish I wouldn’t get so distracted.” The reality is: she had a lot going on. She had some personal things happen during her time at college and other mental health issues occur. Because of all this stuff she failed things like classes and getting into a certain program on campus that forced her to change her major. All of this stuff was not related to her ADHD or her being “dumb or stupid”, but mostly from extenuating circumstances and not getting used to the “college game” until a few semesters in. All of this is to say that you can still push through your failures and still succeed! I also challenge you to think of some other reasons you’ve failed some of your classes. Was it because of ADHD, or not getting it? Was it the “not quite used to college” feeling? Did you have a good support system, a healthy friend group, a healthy lifestyle (as healthy as you can get in college)? Did you spend your weekends drinking and avoiding homework? Did you take advantage of tutoring, office hours, and other homework related supports? These are some other things to consider that you could make changes to if these also affected your grades.

findapath,plumber,comment,1ctysqq,,"Fellow ADHDer, late diagnosed (at 26) and almost failed out of college (going into my senior year with like a 2.0 GPA lol).  First of all, you’re not stupid, you’ve got ADHD.  It’s not a reflection of your intelligence in the slightest.  My best advice to you for right now is to reach out to your academic advisors and your school’s disability support department and request accommodations.  Get everything you can, don’t be shy to ask for extensions on assignments, or notetakers, or extra time on tests, or whatever you need.  Our society is optimized for neurotypical people, but you absolutely can and will succeed at anything with the right tools.  Seek treatment for your ADHD with either therapy or medication if either is an option for you, and don’t ever limit yourself.

With that being said, truck driving is a valuable skill and a job that we need desperately just about anywhere.  Most companies pay pretty well, and some here in the US will even help you get your commercial license.  If you like to travel and you enjoy working on your own, I say absolutely go for it.  Just like any skill, all it takes is some instruction from an expert and then a ton of practice.  Tying your shoes and riding a bike used to be “complex” at one time, too.  But, if you don’t want to drive trucks, don’t force yourself into it because you don’t think you can do anything else.  Think about what hobbies you like to do, what kinds of activities trigger that hyperfixation for you, and see if there might be something in there that you can do for a living.

Take a deep breath, forgive yourself for failing because failure is an integral part of life’s journey, and take the steps to set yourself up for success when you dust yourself off and try again.",1,1716240643.0,l4xmbpk

You could have a hormonal imbalance or some other underlying issue that is affecting your energy and presence of mind. in a way that manifests as memory lapses and all that.

Yes, a ""simpler"" job might be lower stress and easier to keep up with but every job requires time management, recalling information and focus on the task at hand as well as preparing for next actions/steps by following a sequence. All of that can be impacted by memory lapses so I'd work at improving your overall condition before selling yourself short. But even if you can't fully overcome your issues, you can still excel at something as you familiarize yourself with the routine and it becomes second nature. I'm sure all you need is a chance.

The-soy-sauce is giving you good advice. Contact with nature can help, especially if your issues are driven by anxiety, attention deficit or something like that. But you don't need to work with plants necessarily, you can get similar benefit just by walking, ideally in a park or forest nearby. Exercise, even if it's just light mobility and recovery exercises, can also help. I find the YT channel Squat University to be very inspiring in that regard, especially the short videos that show how to overcome weak spots and recover from injury.

Good luck.",2,1715956889.0,l4gmx03

findapath,plumber,post,1b3213z,How can I help my wife (30 f) find a new career path?,"Had a pretty tough conversation the other night with my wife. She was really upset about being in her thirties and still working entry level retail jobs. The unpredictable schedules, low pay, and lack of upward mobility in her current position is pretty frustrating for her. What I got out of the conversation was that she really just wants a typical 9 to 5 job with decent pay. 

Figuring out what kind of job she should pursue has been a struggle. She spent most of her 20s pursuing acting and theater as a career path and working odd jobs to help out with paying bills. The pandemic shifted her perspective a bit, so she's realizing now that pursuing acting wasn't really making her happy. The thing is, she went to an acting conservatory for post secondary instead of going to university and most 9 to 5 office jobs in our area require a bachelor's degree. 

I can't exactly make this decision for her, but I'd also like to help her figure out a way to make her happy in her career. I make a pretty good living in tech and we live in a smaller city with lower cost of living, so we make enough for us to both live a comfortable modest lifestyle. We're also thinking about having children and honestly money has been the biggest barrier for us to having kids. ",116,1709218050.0,

 Creativity? Collaboration? Having an audience? The adoration (nothing wrong with that)? The pressure of having somebody else's work in your hand?  


 Then, think about careers that have some of these abstract qualities. Maybe they can provide similar feeling or fulfill similar roles in her psychy.  


 But she had a path. A passion. A dream that she went after in earnest. She might tell you one thing and feel another. Like that she wants a boring 9-5.

findapath,plumber,comment,1b3213z,,"as a systems/network admin here's my two cents: 

  
To preface: working in tech does not always mean being a developer which is what a lot of people think. Every company uses a growing amount of tech and they need people to manage, implement and troubleshoot all that stuff. These careers are more approachable although not necessarily easy. But you don't need to be developing code/software to start in the field.

  
If you want to go into this side of tech start with some certifications, the CCNA and Cicso courses in general are some of the best, but there's also the comptia sec+ and many others. Before even starting them google stuff about them and find some youtube courses that cover the material, there is a ton. Try to follow along as well as you can and if you kinda understand or are confident you could learn the material look into actually getting the certification.

Without a degree your other option after/during certs is a homelab. Get an old computer and learn how to turn it into a server, then practice implementing the things your certs taught you. This can serve as a good way to show that you know how to do the things the certs teach. There's definitely debate over how useful this actually is on a resume, but it will help your knowledge.

After that, or even while you're doing it, try to find a help desk position. This will be the trial by fire that gets you job experience. It's generally very busy and mind numbing at times but it's really the only entry level position in this field. Once you put a year or two in there you try to apply with certs + homelab + helpdesk experience and start working your way up to sysadmin type roles, or elevated helpdesk roles even.

This is the general path I took but I have a degree as well, but it's just an Associate's in IT. I actually got this job before I even had the degree and there's a lot of debate over how much a degree matters, comes down to who's hiring oftentimes.",7,1709233230.0,ksqhspa

findapath,plumber,post,1dduov4,"I'm 20 and just graduated with a degree I hate, now what?","Hey everyone, I feel like I'm burning up. 

I just graduated with a filmmaking degree, but the problem is, after 2 years of college and 3 years of university, I despise filmmaking now. I hate the people, I hate how saturated with said people the job market is, and I hate the stress of finding work when you have little to no experience. 

I didn't really make any work I was happy with while at uni, other than one film, but the director seems to think he's an auteur and has the biggest ego of anyone I've ever met. He seems to think the film is going to become a cult classic from the beginning of his filmmaking career, and won't even give me a copy to be used in my showreel (see why I hate the people?) and of course, there's always someone with a better portfolio, that will get hired for a job instead of you. 

Filmmaking is all about the people you know, but you can't know people without working, and you can't get work without knowing people. It's a vicious circle. You can attend talks and network all you like, and there's still no guarantee you're going to get a job out of it.

I would love to make a load of short films to make a showreel from, but I'm now working 4-5 days a week in a very mentally stressing job just to make ends meet. I spend the other 2-3 days recovering before I have to do it all again. It's making me really unhappy, demotivated and depressed.

I've been speaking to my other friends that did the uni course, one of which has spoken to some industry professionals, who have said that there is almost no work for beginning filmmakers, and considering the amount of jobs I've applied to (it's in the hundreds), and haven't even heard back, I am inclined to agree with this.

I need to get out of filmmaking, but it's all I've ever wanted to do since I was about 9 years old, I'm 20 now. I'm still young and have time to switch things up, but I have literally no idea what other jobs I could do, I work retail at the moment, but I can't do it forever. I need out, but into what?

findapath,plumber,comment,1dduov4,,"Fellow Film major here with two undergrad degrees in film and currently in the middle of my masters. This is a lot to unpack but lets take it one piece at a time.

""I didn't really make any work I was happy with while at uni, other than one film""

Are you me? cause I had a similar experience. My university focused on documentary which was frustrating and we did do a handful of short film projects but nothing I'm particularly proud of. I am proud of my capstone film because I won an award but it's literally about a famous pornographer lmao. So your experience definitely isn't unique. Lots of filmmakers just go for the experience and to get some sort of degree which is good in this job market even if it isn't paying off right away. I wouldn't stress about this.

""He seems to think the film is going to become a cult classic from the beginning of his filmmaking career, and won't even give me a copy to be used in my showreel (see why I hate the people?)""

Yes OP! literally the same thing happened to me bro. Fucking assholes in our program got into their own clique early on and treated everyone like shit on projects. They wouldn't communicate with teammates that weren't their friends and were particularly nasty to me when they found out I have my own gear and my own startup. They started sabotaging my products, talking shit to me in front of the whole class, and a bunch of other shit. Again, you aren't alone, lots of arts programs attract these types and they hardly ever make it anywhere so don't worry about your buddy. He won't get far with that attitude.

""I would love to make a load of short films to make a showreel from, but I'm now working 4-5 days a week in a very mentally stressing job just to make ends meet.""

This is tough but I would start small and do what you can whenever you have time. I'm just now getting my next short out and I started working on the shit 2 years ago. You don't have to necessarily rush, just keep making progress when you can.

""one of which has spoken to some industry professionals, who have said that there is almost no work for beginning filmmakers""

This is false. I started working on sets when I was 12 as an extra and my old agent asked about me and got me a gig on a new film filming in Louisiana. I'm literally getting paid like $600 for 2 days of work with more opportunities I could have taken if I still lived in that state. You can find work, it just won't be a directing or cinematographer gig. I would start by hitting up a casting agency and taking work as an extra to get your foot in the door if you want to work film sets. From there network and get yourself a PA gig. Definitely don't fall into negativity, cause that will get you nowhere.

So yeah, I would take a breather and focus on just trying to free your schedule and look for some extra gigs online. fuck your director friend and don't feel bad about film school. It's just one phase of life. Best of luck and I'm here to dm if you want to talk.",4,1718169722.0,l8891gv

He can post photos on craigslist and sell them, or take them to local farmers market and craft fairs. Some people like other items like boats, planes, trains. Of course the birds don't care they just want a safe space that doesn't get too hot or wet.

findapath,plumber,comment,18ufja4,,"Go do any camp work. 

The advantages of camp work are: seeing beautiful wilderness, having zero expenses whilst at work, a temporary reprieve from crippling loneliness as you hang out with a bunch of wild and slightly unhinged people. The disadvantages of camp work are: you ain't gonna find a wife out there, and if you find one back home you'll probably lose her.
There are jobs associated with lots of camp work where you can earn decent money without having the danger of being the guy doing the job. Be a camp chef, be a camp cleaner.

Forestry (tree planting, logging, etc): Tree planting is zero investment to get into piece work that will pay well if you can get good. Logging is insanely dangerous but pays very well. I'd say logging is more dangerous than a lot of fisheries.

Fishing: find out what fisheries exist, find out what town the boats leave from, find out when the seasons are. Go a month or so early and hang out at the bar nearest the dock, and on the docks. Talk to everyone. Don't do dragging, it's fucking evil. Don't do krill, whales need it. Don't do large sein net fishing, unless you have personally talked to a local marine biologist who can assure you they manage the fishery sustainably (they don't). Do long lining for halibut etc, do tuna, do crab (maybe not in Alaska), work on boats that have divers, get into related jobs like being a 'packer'.

Mining: I haven't done this myself in any capacity, so I've got no idea. Surely the same basic rules apply, find jobs and apply for them - go do them.

Other resource extraction fields: As your conscience dictates, availability assuming.

Environment jobs: Park ranger, ...

Tourism jobs: Glacier guide, ski or scuba instructor, hiking guide, mountaineer, ...",1,1703994288.0,kfni3nv

findapath,plumber,post,17fhsxf,What careers would you recommend for those in their 30's and beyond?," I'm in my thirties and still haven't figured out what to do with myself. I quit my retail job stocking shelves a month ago now I'm unemployed and bored. I have been in and out of community college for a 6+ years now and after these last 3 classes I would hopefully be able to transfer to a university. But I have wasted so much time in CC being directionless, indecisive, and having poor grades I don't know if I'll even be able to go back after dropping out of uni some years ago. And after all this time I never managed to figure out what interests me or what I liked. I know what I dislike: selling, standing in once spot all day, managing people, being cold/wet, and constant driving. 

Right now I'm OK. I'm in debt from school and don't have a job but I live with parents and don't have to worry about kids or having a partner to tie down in the future so I have some freedom to do stuff but don't know what.

I also know plenty of people my age who spent years and hundreds of thousands of dollars getting law degrees and other expensive post grad degrees in their 20s who in their 30s, hate their jobs and their lives. Being forced to make your career choice at 18 is not necessarily a good thing. 

Meanwhile my husband - 43M - went BACK to college as an older student after being a bartender for 15 years. Before we met, he figured he’d do that his whole life. At 36, he went back to community college, started with remedial classes, then got his bachelors degree at age 40. He landed a good job he enjoys enough with HBO he got through a  college internship. I’m in a job I’ve been at for 8 years that I’ve wanted to leave for 4 years, but for a variety of reasons, haven’t left  - but now it’s time. People nowadays change their jobs on average every 3 years and on average have 5 dif CAREERS throughout their lives. But it’s definitely easier to get a new job, even if you change industries, when you HAVE a job.

Unfortunately a bachelors degree is still necessary for a lot of jobs so unless you’re interested in something more manual and techy, get your bachelors in anything - it really doesn’t matter what, then start just trying things. Stay for a couple years and if you don’t love it, take what you learned and make a lateral move and switch industries. That’s what I plan on doing and what sooo many people do these days .

I get caught up sometimes like a deer in headlights when I feel like I have to decide RIGHT NOW exactly what i want to do for the rest of my life with choosing my next job. Buuuut it’s really not that serious. You can always change jobs and change industries and change careers. People don’t stay at one job for 30 years anymore so try to not let that pressure get to you. Being 30 doesn’t mean you’re too old for anything - TBH I think my husband got his internship and eventually a really good job BECAUSE he was older, more mature and more serious than the kiddos also applying.

\#3 Being a SWE is not for everyone.

\#4 The market for SWE is kind of cold right now, and with AI tools making middleware tools like PowerApps etc more dangerous there is going to be less work in the future that doesnt mesh directly into business. Coding is useful in every profession, I know a person who makes twice what I do because they know powerquery, excel, and can speak C level Exec.

\#5 the value of human labor is going to increase (we are already seeing it in the trades), as software gets more trivial to create. There are only so many things businesses use software for, or even computers can do. Everything is just a new coat of paint on top of an old internet structure.

Do you want to live your life and know at the end you could have accomplished any number of things but you didn't accomplish anything because you were too lazy and too unmotivated to select goals for yourself and work to achieve them? Because that is what life is about.

Nobody ""enjoys"" doing repetitive things, but our lives are filled with them. We have to clean ourselves daily, we have to cook for ourselves daily, we have to clean up our homes frequently, we have upkeep chores to do to keep things running in our homes, we have to go to work and perform many similar tasks daily, etc. Much of life is repetitive, but what are you working towards? Yeah, I was doing a lot of the same things at work every month as an accountant but I worked my ass off and got promoted; Now I am doing different things in a higher role than before. Now I get paid more and can take more trips to different places and experience new things and break up the routine of my life. I feel pride in the good work I have done to help my company and am happy that my company and coworkers recognize my importance, skill, and hard work. 

As a professional, I am always learning new skills and expanding what I can do for a company. That is fun. Progression isn't monotonous, it means you are growing as a person and are not staying stagnant. Work and life can be repetitive, but its up to you to grow as a person and keep learning new things so your work and life doesn't stay stagnant and repetitive. That's on you, nobody else.

What differentiates the best lawyers/doctors/programmers from the average ones? They might be a little more intelligent, but they undoubtedly have a higher standard for their work and in turn have a higher standard for their work ethic. You just have to put in the effort, and your intelligence typically carries you in the right direction of what to do. But you have to stick with it and continue on.

I don’t know what your next move, especially so if you don’t. Only you know that. And if you’re intelligent enough you should be able to figure it out. 

You have to figure out a goal and dugouts out smaller more achievable goals that in combination will lead you to the grander one. That’s really all that life is, in a nutshell. And how to determine those goals is entirely your job as a human being, to yourself. You need to remember that what you do is your life and you indeed are in control of things. Figure out a way to be happy, to be motivated, and to have direction in your life. I truly don’t think there’s anything else to life than doing that, since everything else just follows through.

Money? Fuck that. That’ll come once you figure yourself out. If all you want is money, you will destroy your soul. In fact, if all you want is one thing, you’ll destroy your soul because life truly is a matter of balancing things.

I recommend you try to figure what goals you want to achieve and to just figure out steps to get there. Do you still want to *actually* be a physicist? It’s not just solving physics problems in high-school. I thought I wanted to study Mathematics in highschool, and went and did it in colleges. But halfway through my senior year I didn’t want to pursue it any further, because it became so much unlike anything I actually expected. It wasn’t intuitive, easy, fun going math… no, it was the hardest stuff they could throw at us and still have the exams not average out to be an F. I think physics would be the same, and would very much humble your opinion that you’re intelligent.

2) You likely have a sense of “addiction” to learning and achieving mastery - not just “kind of learn to do this,” but to absolutely “lean in” in an obsessive fashion.

3) The people you are able to connect with and build a relationship with you are absolutely loyal and devoted to without restrain.

4) Most things in life are trivial and you basically just live to conquer the next mountain or make the next great discovery/breakthrough in what you do.

5) You quickly develop “tunnel vision” while doing things. Some people call it “flow” or engaging the “zone of genius” with the smallest of questions that people ask you. No superficial answers, I’m giving exact advice with every move planned out and every possible outcome already neatly calculated, risks measured, potential payout, etc. 

6) Probably a perfectionist, except the standards actually work because you can keep up with them no sweat.

There’s actually studies that were done some years ago that looked to measure the optimal IQ of an individual based on how it translates to their success. I can’t cite it, maybe you could just google it, but it concluded that higher IQ could be related to higher success which peaked in the mid 120’s to low 130’s range and then drastically dropped after like 131 due to people being unable to build relationships and connect with others. 

Most healthy relationships lie within a 15 IQ margin. So at 130 you lose connection to a large portion of the population without proper training and education.

I’d keep dropping nuggets but I imagine my wife thinks I dropped dead on the toilet by now. My advice is probably get the ADHD treated. I just assume that 9/10, if someone can say “he had so much potential” - ADHD was right there to stop you from achieving anything. 10 years of failing sounds like one such case.

I went back to school a few years ago and got a degree in computer science. With GenAI and the layoffs, I can't say I know what to do.  
  
I lost my corporate job back in June due to a layoff. I've been freelancing ever since, with mixed results. My wife is in the VR assistant space and doesn't make that much. All of this is due to be impacted in 2024 by AI.  
  
It's so easy to say ""skill up"" or ""Stop being worried,"" but my child's wellbeing is at stake here. This is a weight I've never felt before in my life. If I fail, they fail with me, at no fault of their own.  
  
I've thought of a path forward, but it's expensive and labor-intensive, with no guarantees of success. I'd have to go back to school again and get a certificate in AI at a cost of $10,000, right when I'm broke and bringing new life into the world. How can I justify that?  
  
More to the point, it would take a year or so to get the certificate. I have no freaking idea if it would be just as useless on the other side as a pure CS degree is set to be now. And how do I keep the lights on in the meantime?  
  
I haven't slept in days over this. My mind is racing, and I just need someone to help, to say a few words to ground me, to help me think this through. I really don't mean to be a doomer, but I'm kind of deep in panic mode over here.

I work in a call center for the trades, but if it were me in this position with your credentials, which are good, why not look into technical sales? The sales people for the trades close 10-50k jobs and make like 10% they make in the low 6 figures. 

Option 1: Spend a little cash on professional resume builder, I heard Comptia certs are really good if you want to skill up for cheap and learn some really useful stuff, imagine if you had several comptia certs under your belt along with your experience and degree that might look quite appealing and as far as I know you can study the material on your own then show to take the test and bam! You got your certs you can list. 

Option 2: once again professional resume writer look for one that specializes in tech, make sure you spend time detailing everything you can that you have ever done productively, upload your resume on Indeed, I would download the app though it gives you more control, I would also have indeed open on 2 devices, then you can start with whats in your area for technical sales or just jobs in general to start applying to, when you are about to send your resume indeed asks for supporting documents you can add, in there you can add your cover letter by typing and start sending those over. Im sure you get 10-15 job apps a day that is not bad, then wait a week after every bout of job apps you send and you can message them your interest. If they dont respond in a few days maybe give the company a call and ask to speak with the hiring manager and that you sent your resume over and wanted to discuss the position as you have excellent qualifications that transfer well.

Option 3: community colleges near you offer certificates which can really stack your experience with the certs, you can optionally do both comptia and a few semesters in college. Just search in your local CC’s webpage for computer science and see what they offer and schedule a sit down with the counselor. They will help you with a game plan, you can get your comptia certs as well and double up. I mean it sounds like you really want to move in a direction and you dont know where- you have a lot of options. Good luck to you, Im sure you will do great, keep a positive attitude and a cool head.

Option 4. Regular sales jobs may work as well you can do freelancing along with sales, one option if you live in the states is Insurance sales, you can get a few licenses and take the test to sell insurance or you can try your hand on sales positions like solar, technical, or other positions. Just having a degree especially a CompSci degree opens many doors for you. A lot of Sales people have an AA or less and do very well. Hope this helps I really do wish you well",2,1703783979.0,kfageiu

findapath,plumber,comment,18swnvt,,"I also lost my job when my daughter was about to be born. It was much worse than that actually.

First, to me there are no guarantees of success. The outcome depends on many things that are out of my control. I focus on what I can do. And I do what I believe that will take me to the right direction.

I was heavily criticized by many people about the things I did. Even waking up early to go do a networking event, which didn't cost me much and it was better than sleeping and staying unemployed.

But I didn't do what others said, they don't know my situation, what I want, etc. 

It wasn't an easy or quick journey. I took some very bad jobs. Former employers helped me with some projects. I worked very late at night, like midnight to 6am for a period. I had to choose between using the money to eat something or take the bus back home.

Still, it was much better to move to something better than staying where I was, stressing about what I couldn't change, etc.

That was about 15 years ago (I'm 50 now, so I was close to your age). My life is not perfect, but people even asked me to write a book about my experience to overcome the challenges (still working on that, maybe not a book). I achieved more than anyone expected in many ways. My life changed drastically, and that's expected to move from something really bad to something good.

I'm not in CS to give you specific advice about what to do. But I'm in marketing, also affected by AI (although that started  to me many years ago, before the current versions of AI). And, given my age, I was also affected by computers, software, coding, social media, globalization, September 11, among other things. AI is just another thing in the the list to me, the arrival of computers and internet was much scarier to me than AI. And I'm still here. So, I know we can still do it even when we don't know what to do. Nobody knew what to do in many of those situations, but we overcame the challenges anyway.",1,1703804480.0,kfc1r0x

If you let your family down because of your dignity and trying to make it work in an industry because you got some certifications then refused to adapt to an evolving environment idk if you’d forgive yourself.

You can simply do part time courses or job hunt on the side or nights part time and work a sales job which is easy to get and can be pretty insane and income levels.

A good car salesman who works smart not hard will make 200k+/year working 40-45 hours a week.

A good B2B salesman will make 200k+ working 40-45 hours a week.

A mediocre tech/medical salesman will make 200k+ working 40-45 hours a week.

Need I go on? Any sales job can easily net you crazy money for the amount of work you do. But only if you work smart not hard.

So you need to decide what is more important. You being happy because you can land a job in a specific industry  that may or may not be reliable with the evolving environment and constant layoffs in tech. 

Or go at life head on and form your own path based on your work ethic and easily be able to find a job anywhere you want on the spot.

I do game dev part time as the salary is not really there now days unless you run a studio. I’m not god at coding but I enjoy it so I work on indie products part time. I sell cars to pay the bills. I don’t enjoy selling cars but I was at wits end and needed a job within 24 hour notice 10 years ago.

I got hired on the spot first place I went and just accepted I do this for money now.

Since then it has changed my life in ways I never thought possible. You don’t have to sell cars I’m just saying when life puts you to the test just be willing to be open minded about different opportunities. 

Food for thought a lazy constantly stoned half ass salesman in most cities will make 70-80k a year and that’s not based on the last few years with crazy prices.

You’re having difficulty finding work. You seem set on this notion that it’s because genAI is or will make you obsolete. So then you seem set on getting into AI so that you’re ahead of the curve and less replaceable. So then you seem set on getting some certification that you think will get you a machine learning job. 

One thing at a time. I think the idea that genAI will replace engineers (in any niche, including web dev) in the immediate future is laughable. For one thing, I’m not convinced the tooling is there yet, but more pertinently, the hard parts of engineering to me have always been solving domain (ie business) problems. I don’t really care that chatgpt can spit out some Python code faster than me, I know that it’s currently impossible to feed it all of my company’s BS and have it fix all of our problems. That’s what gives me confidence that I won’t be replaced any time soon. 

Rather than “AI has replaced me”, isn’t it far more likely that you’re just relatively junior and looking for a job at a rough time? I know that isn’t exactly comforting, but accepting that would help you focus on the right things and save you a huge chunk of money on whatever certification you’re looking for.

So about me:

Late 20s(f) US based. Married with a 2 year and currently pregnant due next year.  SAHM and really enjoying it. Cash is tight however. 

BA in Economics and Minor in Sustainability

Loan processing for veteran mortgages. Trained and managed teams. (Miserable)

Field research for an engineering company contracted for emergency services. Trained teams. (Loved the travel)

Volunteered in urban farming and non profit construction related things. (My favorite gigs)

Long time restaurant server and bartender. Trained lots of people. (Really good at sales, but absolutely hate it)

Real passions:

sustainability, be it environmental or social, not so much policy/Econ 

I am interested in sustainable design practices for homes and green spaces. 

I love photography, which comes naturally to me and I inherited some really cool niche photography tools. I am out of practice but willing to get back into it. 

I really enjoy home making. Cooking, gardening, and I would love to have time and funds to learn more home making skills. 

I love the outdoors and relaxing in the sun but also pretty much any outdoor activity or sport, I am not avid at anything. We may move into an RV in the not so distant future if my husbands job starts having him travel more.  

I hate to pump my own tires, but usually get promoted or leveled up quickly because I can be a hard worker, quick to learn, love to learn new things, good at research, pretty likable, reliable, organized, and get shit done. 

I burn out when it’s something that doesn’t bring me joy. I’m an introverted extrovert. A mix of wfh and field work is ideal. Not into coding at all but I don’t mind computer work. 

My original plan was to study environmental science but didn’t want to be a researcher my whole life. I had zero guidance in higher education, I am a first generation college grad. My dad, my biggest supporter and inspiration, died when I was 19. My step family pushed their “money over everything” mindset on me, hence me giving up my passions to get an easy degree to guarantee me a well paying job straight out of school.  Once he died I went on autopilot and just did what I was advised to do, which has greatly hindered my personal development. I’ve just kind of gone through the motions for the last (gasp) almost decade. 

I do not do well in structured routines, aka the 9-5.  I would love the schedule of a nurse, but I am way too squeamish. I thrive with each day being different. I don’t want to think about work when I get off. 

I’m also limited now because of kids! If I could stay home to take care of them and afford doing things I enjoy, I would be so happy. Unfortunately, even though my husband supports this, he doesn’t make enough for me to not work and for us both to enjoy hobbies. Things are very tight. We are able to afford life in a MCOL area with a little extra savings, but we do nothing extra. We are only able to put his employee match towards retirement at the moment. He has higher income potential in the future but it is a slow growth. We have modest student loan debt, so with that coming back we will be more behind in saving. 


I am struggling between:

wanting to stay home with my kids for those benefits to them, but barely making it. 

Wanting to have any job for extra money short term. Build up savings? A full time job means full time daycare, which may be a wash money wise. Plus then no time for hobbies. 

A part time job, contract position, or owning my own flexible hours business. Maybe able to afford part time childcare to focus on job? Would be nice to have the best of both worlds. I gain a lot of personal value by bringing in a paycheck (unfortunately I haven’t shaken this mindset). 

I don’t mind continuing education, especially because I will be home for sure at least the next year raising babies. 

My husbands job may relocate us a few times in the next few years. Not confirmed. Job with that flexibility would be a plus. We could potentially relocate for my career also. We are not settled on staying where we are. 


Most recent things I’ve considered:

Landscape architecture

Surveyer 

Home appraiser or inspector 

Photography business

Air traffic controller (gov job and benefits, plus early retirement, plus I think I’d be really good at it, sucky hours)

Graphic Design

findapath,wind technician,post,1chx6jk,Good paths for someone with cognitive difficulties/learning disabilities?,"I am 31 and I have spent my 20s working miscellaneous jobs and going to school. I managed to get a degree in exercise science 4 years ago and didn't do terribly, but it was at a university widely considered to be less challenging.

I've noticed a trend in my life of just......not being good at/savvy with things. I would definitely say I'm not particularly bright and I have issues with math and technology. I've always been the sort of person who gets good reviews at my jobs with no interpersonal issues, but I never get selected for the promotion or to be in charge of anything important. I feel like I'm considered reliable and happy to work, but not intelligent enough for meaningful leadership

I'm also in good shape, but I've had a few accidents and bad genetic dice rolls that make me a bit less attractive than average. While this would normally not be a big deal in most professions, I feel it held me back a bit as a personal trainer and I'd like to make enough money to get some of my problems corrected before going back into the field.

What are good paths for someone who struggles with STEM stuff, but has the following going for them-

* Healthy and fit
* Enjoys working with people
* No family obligations
* No criminal record/can pass drug test
* Doesn't mind traveling
* Enjoys working evenings/nights

I’d suggest just getting your gen-ed completed until you figure out what you want to do in life. No one can tell you what you should do with your life, otherwise we all would be way more unsatisfied with our lives. Usually people decide what to study based off their interests or passions. For example, I’m very passionate about psychology, I’m going to grad school to become a clinical social worker. Psychology has always been my favorite subject because as generic as it sounds, I like learning about why we, people, are the way we are and what factors into that. 

But I do want to leave you with this piece of advice. You’re 16, it is totally normal and okay for you to not have everything figured out yet. There is no deadline you have to meet. All that matters is that YOU feel fulfilled by what you make of your life.

findapath,wind technician,post,1cuearl,I’m so lost,"Hi Reddit. 
Im 27 year old Male. I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I was living in Galway for 7 years and I was going out with the most amazing woman. We truly loved eachother and once she finished college she decided to move back home with her parents. I waited for her to finish college so we could start our lives together. I decided to move back in with my patients even though I didn’t want to. I said I would go back to college and get a different degree. I’ve never known what I wanted to do ever since I’ve been a kid. I’ve worked in 23 different jobs since I’ve been 16 and none of them light the spark in me. I always question myself and ask “is this really what I want to do” Anyways. I was worried about the distance leaving Galway as our homes were 2 hours away. I didn’t find the distance bad. However, she was finding it tough. She would come down on the weekends and I would go up to her we would take it in rotation, every weekend i went up to hers it was filled with questions about what I had my concerns over when we leaving Galway. She said the weekends were too short and then it was back into work again on Monday. She said she doesn’t have fun anymore even though when She came to my house I’d always have something planned and when I went to hers we would just hangout. We went on holidays together and we fought most of the time we were there. Over silly stuff. So we’re still kind of talking but that is driving me crazy as I’m not sure wheather to move on or have hope for the future. My head is so fried. It feels like we’re taking a break but where still talking and being faithful to eachother. She still gets mad at me for stuff even though we’ve broken up. 
 I’m training as a dental technician and I enjoy some parts of the job but to me it just seems like a dead end. I don’t get any enjoyment out of working. only that I’m helping people better their lives. I started this job to have a good future for us and now that she’s gone I’m thinking what’s the point. 
Every job seems mundane and I think there’s too much choice out there. 
I fight with my parents regularly because I come home in a bad mood from work because I don’t like the job. 
Sometimes I just think I’d be better off ending it all. I’m so lost and everyone around me is getting on with their jobs and careers. Making money and buying nice things (cars, houses,holidays) here’s me… making the same money I was when I was 22 because I keep careers hopping and can’t be happy with what I have. 
It’s a bit long winded but I’m not a great writer. Any suggestions? ",1,1715974915.0,

When it comes to jobs I'll tell you what I tell everyone. If you really want or need a job, goto Seattle. That area has a shit ton of jobs and part of the reason is because alot of their jobs are recession proof.

Back in 2008 I lost my job as a dental hygienist. No jobs in San Francisco, my friend who also lived in San Francisco went jobless during that period for 1 1/2 years. I moved to Seattle and found a full time job in 10 days and it wasn't the only job offer, I had my choice of another office in Bellevue.

Everyone sees Seattle as being a tech mecca (Amazon, Microsoft, T-Mobile, etc), but the truth of the matter is, it's much more. The UW gets more government funding than any other University. If you wanna do research, they have great opportunities. The huge naval base in Bremerton is home to thousands and thousands of jobs maintaining ships. There's a submarine base in Bangor home to a Marine platoon that fixes nuclear subs. These are all government jobs. Then there's JBLM which is the biggest military base.

Boeing has a number of manufacturing facilities in and around the Puget Sound. The airplane industry does not follow normal economic trends when it comes to recessions as orders are placed well in advance. These are not government jobs but they are union jobs that require engineering and Boeing does manufacture planes/drones/missiles for the Dept of Defense.

The number of jobs needed in the Seattle area run the gamut from people with PHD's all the way down to the folks who paint the ships. My cousin does data analytics with a hospital in downtown Seattle. Another cousin does social media marketing with Swedish. If you're a dental hygienist like me you could make a living from temping as there's a huge shortage. 

Seattle isn't for everybody, I left for a reason. We're in the middle of December, those folks won't see sunlight for another 2 months. It's cold and wet over there and it hellish if it gets icy/snowy. The people in Seattle aren't exactly the friendliest people either (see Seattle Freeze).

findapath,solar installer,comment,18jeqjr,,"Depends which route you go. There are a few major packaging programs in the US and some are more engineering focused (Rutgers) and some are a Bach of Science (Michigan State, RIT, Clemson). 

There are two major pathways: working for a consumer packaged goods company (CPG) aka Coke, Kellogg's, etc. or working for a packaging supplier (supplies boxes, labels, bottles, etc). CPG is moreso developing and testing consumer packaging for the marketing team, think water or shampoo bottles, and is less engineering and more project team based. You can go to factories and help with conducting technical trials.

If you're working for a packaging supplier, which provides packaging to CPG companies, you can be extremely technical or go the sales route.

With the big push to make packaging more sustainable, and with everything requiring packaging (food, pharmaceutical, personal care, beverage, etc.) it has almost 100% job security long term.

I went to MSU (the biggest packaging program in the US) and was offered a job before graduation. Now I'm 8 years in, work for a large CPG company and my total compensation package is 200k+. Plus, I have recruiters reaching out to me on a weekly basis on LinkedIn for other job opportunities.

You can usually tell someone who tours just by how they wrap cable or start taking a leadership role by default.

It's kind of tough to describe... I don't know how I became me, professionally speaking, but there's a whole lot of crazy shit, travel and looong days. I can't really recommend this industry to many people because you're either on-board with showing up early, never having stable income, working weird and insane hours and getting paid creatively... Or you're not. It was much more acceptable in my 20's than now, with kids... But such is life. 

On the plus side, I still love piloting boom lifts and climbing. Rope access is still fun as long as I don't do it too much, which I don't. I really enjoy building a really clean plan and feeling confident in my load math. Finding creative solutions when Tyler the Creator's camp submits a ridiculous plan to the festival three weeks late, the night before the show is a fun kind of stress. Plus it just feels good to do something you're good at and get rewarded for it...",1,1702751844.0,kdn9n6c

But I feel like if you didn't get like a 3.5 in high-school they would just auto decline you yah know? Idk maybe my life experience and military experience could help me get in.
